## ❓ QUESTIONS YOU NEED TO ANSWER NOW

### Question 1: Application Portal Access
**Do you have the link to submit?**
- Where did you see the original RFP?
- Is there an application portal link in the RFP document?
- Do you need to create an account first?

**ACTION**: Search "National Geographic Society Future of Learning application portal 2025" or check the RFP doc for submission instructions.

---

### Question 2: Pascal Status
**Have you contacted Pascal yet?**
- ☐ Yes, waiting for response
- ☐ Not yet - send email NOW (use template provided)
- ☐ Can't reach him in time - will submit without formal partnership

**ACTION**: Make decision NOW about partnership language in application.

---

### Question 3: Reality Check
**Can you honestly execute this project if funded?**

Think about:
- Would you choose this over Center for Healthy Minds job if both came through?
- Do you have capacity to lead this alongside other commitments?
- Are you genuinely excited about doing this work?

**If YES**: Submit with confidence.

**If UNCERTAIN**: You can still submit—getting funding doesn't mean you MUST accept. You can always decline if circumstances change. But don't submit something you know you can't/won't do.

**If NO**: Consider whether there's a different version of this (Bloom-focused? Different scope?) that you WOULD be excited about, and pivot the application accordingly.
