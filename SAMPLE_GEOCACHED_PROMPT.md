### BEFORE YOU ARRIVE

**Read this mini-story:**

For centuries, the Seine was Paris's sewer. By 1960, the river was so polluted that no fish could survive. Parisians turned their backs on it—literally, building walls and highways that separated the city from its river.

But in the 1990s, something changed. Water treatment plants were built. Industrial discharge was regulated. Fish began to return. Today, over 30 species live in the Seine, and Paris is planning to make it swimmable by 2025 for the first time in a century.

You're about to visit one of the bridges where this quiet revolution is visible—if you know how to look.

**Your question to hold**:
*What does it take for a river to come back to life? And what does that say about planetary health?*

---

### WHEN YOU ARRIVE

**📍 Stand at the bridge (Pont de la Tournelle)**

1. **Look down at the water.** Notice the color, the movement, any reflections.
   - Take a photo facing upstream (east, toward Notre-Dame)
   - Take a photo facing downstream (west, toward Eiffel Tower)

2. **Observe for 5 minutes without doing anything else.**
   - Set a timer. Just watch the river.
   - Notice what moves: boats, birds, trash, light on water, currents

3. **Document what you see:**
   - Birds: What species? What are they doing? (Feeding, resting, flying?)
   - Plants: Any vegetation along the banks or in the water?
   - Water quality: Clear or murky? Calm or turbulent? Any smell?
   - Human activity: Boats, swimmers, fishers, trash?

---

### YOUR INVESTIGATION

**🔍 The Five Questions:**

Answer these in your Cursive reflection journal (or voice record on your phone):

1. **Biodiversity**: Did you see any living things in or around the river? List every species you noticed (even common pigeons count!). If you saw fish, birds feeding, or plants, what might that tell you about water quality?

2. **Change Over Time**: Imagine this same spot in 1960 (dead river) vs. today. What human actions made the difference? Be specific (e.g., "Someone decided to build a water treatment plant," "Laws banned dumping chemicals").

3. **Interconnections**: Trace one connection between this river and your own daily life. Examples:
   - Does your tap water come from Seine watershed?
   - Does rain from your neighborhood eventually reach this river?
   - Have you eaten fish or plants that depend on this ecosystem?

4. **Planetary Health**: The Seine is one river in one city. But rivers everywhere face similar challenges (pollution, climate change, habitat loss). What would it take for ALL rivers to be as healthy as possible? What role could you play?

5. **Your Action**: Based on what you observed, what is ONE thing you could do in the next week related to water health? Examples:
   - Research where your tap water comes from
   - Reduce water waste at home
   - Pick up trash near a waterway
   - Learn about local watershed restoration projects
   - Teach someone else about river ecosystems

### CREATIVE CHALLENGE (Optional)

**Write a letter to the Seine.**

Imagine the river could read. Write 5-10 sentences:
- Thanking it for something
- Apologizing for something humans have done
- Making a promise for the future

(This can be silly, serious, poetic, scientific—your choice!)

---

### SHARE YOUR LEARNING

**In Cursive:**
- Upload your two photos (upstream and downstream)
- Upload any additional photos (birds, plants, details)
- Write your responses to the Five Questions
- Optional: Share your letter to the Seine

**Your educator will respond within 3 days** with feedback, additional resources, or connections to what other students observed.

### GOING DEEPER (For the Curious)

**If you want to learn more:**

- **Citizen Science**: Join "Eau de Paris" or "Seine en Partage" projects documenting river health
- **Historical Photos**: Search "Seine Paris pollution 1960s" to see what recovery looks like
- **Current Efforts**: Look up "Baignade Seine 2025" to see Paris's plan to make river swimmable
- **Local Ecology**: Visit Maison de la Pêche et de la Nature (nearby) to learn about Seine biodiversity

**Questions for your educator:**
- What species have returned to the Seine since cleanup efforts began?
- How do Parisians use the river today vs. 50 years ago?
- What are the biggest remaining challenges for Seine health?

---

### REFLECTION PROMPT (After Completing This Activity)

**Think back on your 30-45 minutes at the river:**

- What surprised you most?
- Did you notice anything that made you hopeful? Concerned?
- How did it feel to spend time observing one place closely instead of rushing past?
- Would you ever return to this spot just to notice what's changed?

## WHY THIS PROMPT?

**For Educators:**

This prompt demonstrates several principles of embodied learning for planetary health:

1. **Specific Location**: Geocaching ensures students actually visit the site, creating direct sensory experience
2. **Observation Skills**: Prompts students to slow down and notice details they'd normally overlook
3. **Systems Thinking**: Connects local river to global water challenges, personal actions to planetary health
4. **Action-Oriented**: Ends with commitment to concrete action, not just knowledge
5. **Emotional Connection**: Letter-writing invites relationship with more-than-human world
6. **Agency**: Students choose when to visit, how to respond creatively, what action to take
7. **Correspondence**: Educator feedback loop creates ongoing dialogue about learning
8. **SDG Alignment**: Clear connections to SDG 6, 11, 14

**Adaptation for Other Locations:**

This same template works anywhere:
- Replace Seine with your local river, lake, creek, or ocean
- Research that waterway's pollution/restoration history
- Identify species students might observe in your climate
- Connect to local citizen science projects
- Adjust SDGs based on local context (e.g., SDG 15 if focusing on wetlands and land)

**Assessment Opportunities:**

- Pre/post environmental literacy: Compare student responses to these prompts early vs. late in semester
- Action documentation: Track how many students complete their committed action
- Ecological knowledge: Assess ability to identify species, understand water quality indicators
- Systems thinking: Analyze quality of responses about interconnections and planetary health
