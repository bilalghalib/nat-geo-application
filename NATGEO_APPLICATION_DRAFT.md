## PROJECT TITLE
**Place-Based Learning Correspondence: Testing Embodied Educational Protocols for Planetary Stewardship with Learning Planet Institute**

---

## PROJECT SUMMARY (For General Public - 200 words max)

This project tests whether embodied, place-based learning—where students physically engage with their local environment through guided outdoor activities—leads to deeper ecological awareness and action compared to traditional screen-based education.

Working with Learning Planet Institute educators in Paris (a UNESCO partner focused on SDG education), we will pilot **Cursive**, an open-source correspondence protocol that prompts learners to explore their neighborhoods, document biodiversity, and reflect on planetary health challenges. Students will receive geocached prompts that unlock at specific locations—urban parks, waterways, biodiversity hotspots—encouraging direct sensory engagement with their environment.

By comparing outcomes between embodied learning groups and digital-only control groups, we aim to create replicable methods that any educator can use to transform learners into environmental stewards. The project will produce:

1. Measured impact data on environmental awareness and documented actions
2. Open-source toolkit for educators globally (available under Creative Commons)
3. Research findings published through UNESCO's Learning Planet network

If successful, this pilot can scale through LPI's global network of 200+ institutions committed to SDG education, providing evidence-based methods for planetary stewardship education worldwide.

---

## BACKGROUND: Why This Matters Now

### The Paradox of Screen-Based Planetary Education

Learning Planet Institute, a UNESCO Chair in Learning Sciences training the next generation of SDG changemakers, faces a paradox common across sustainability education: students learning about planetary health spend most of their time at screens, disconnected from the very environments they're learning to protect.

Research in embodied cognition and environmental psychology suggests that environmental stewardship develops through direct sensory experience—touching soil, observing seasonal changes, walking watersheds, documenting biodiversity. Yet most educational technology, including LMS platforms and learning apps, keeps students in digital environments rather than supporting engagement with physical place.

### The Opportunity: Correspondence for Embodied Learning

During recent conversations with Learning Planet Institute's Chief Exploration Officer François Taddei and education innovator Pascal Kolbe (Ikigai+ Product Manager at LPI), we identified a critical need: learning infrastructure that gets students into the world rather than keeping them in browsers.

**Cursive** is an open protocol designed specifically for this challenge:
- **Geocached prompts** that unlock at specific physical locations, ensuring students engage with actual environments
- **Reflection tools** for nature documentation, encouraging observation and sense-making
- **Correspondence features** that allow educators to guide learners through embodied exploration rhythms
- **Open architecture** that prioritizes human craft over gamification

### Why Paris? Why Now?

This project is timely for three converging reasons:

1. **UNESCO Framework (2024)**: UNESCO's latest framework emphasizes experiential learning for sustainability education, explicitly calling for methods that connect learners to their local environments

2. **Post-Pandemic Reconsideration**: Education institutions globally are reconsidering screen time and seeking methods that balance digital access with embodied experience

3. **Paris Urban Biodiversity Initiatives**: Paris is launching ambitious urban biodiversity restoration projects where student participation could amplify impact—from urban farming networks to Seine watershed restoration to heat island mitigation through greenspace expansion

### The Learning Planet Advantage

Learning Planet Institute provides an ideal testing ground:
- **Global reach**: 200+ institutions in UNESCO network for scaling
- **Research infrastructure**: Existing assessment frameworks and learning sciences expertise
- **Student diversity**: International student body from 60+ countries
- **Innovation culture**: History of piloting cutting-edge learning methods
- **Partnership readiness**: Active collaboration discussions with Pascal Kolbe's Ikigai+ team

### What Makes This Different

Unlike apps that gamify nature (often extractive in design philosophy), Cursive prioritizes:
- **Local stewardship over global competition**: Students engage with their specific neighborhoods
- **Correspondence rhythms over one-time events**: Ongoing relationships with place
- **Educator customization**: Teachers can create prompts without technical skills
- **Open infrastructure**: Creative Commons licensing ensures accessibility

Unlike traditional field trips (one-time events with high barriers), this creates:
- **Ongoing practice**: Regular embodied engagement integrated into coursework
- **Low resource requirements**: No special equipment or transportation needed
- **Documentation culture**: Students build portfolios of environmental observations

Unlike pure research tools (designed for scientists), this is:
- **Pedagogically grounded**: Built with educators for learning outcomes
- **Assessment-ready**: Designed to measure awareness and action
- **Scalable**: Can work in any geography with any institution

2. **Leverages Institutional Resources**: Using LPI's existing infrastructure (classrooms, student recruitment channels, institutional reputation)
3. **Open Source Efficiency**: Building on existing Cursive development rather than starting from scratch
4. **Local Context**: Based in France, no international travel costs
5. **Partnership Model**: LPI educators contributing time as part of professional development (limited stipends needed)
6. **Sustainable Design**: Investments (toolkit, research, platform) continue providing value long after grant period

**What's Not Included (Covered by Other Sources):**
- LPI's administrative overhead and infrastructure
- François Taddei and Pascal Kolbe's advisory time (contributing as part of institutional partnership)
- Student time (voluntary participation or integrated into coursework)
- Cursive core platform development (separate venture)
- Office space and basic research tools (accessing through LPI and personal resources)
