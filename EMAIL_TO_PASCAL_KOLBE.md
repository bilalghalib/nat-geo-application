# EMAIL TO PASCAL KOLBE - REQUEST FOR PARTNERSHIP SUPPORT

---

**Subject**: Quick partnership question for Nat Geo proposal (due tonight!)

---

Hi Pascal,

I hope you're well! I'm reaching out because I'm submitting a proposal tonight to National Geographic Society's "Future of Learning" grant, and I think there's a natural synergy with your Ikigai+ work at Learning Planet Institute.

**The quick version:**

I'm proposing to pilot **Cursive** (the embodied learning protocol I'm building) with LPI students to test whether place-based, geocached learning activities lead to stronger environmental awareness and action compared to screen-only learning.

The idea: Students use Cursive to explore Paris ecology through guided prompts that unlock at specific locations (Seine River, urban parks, biodiversity sites). We measure impact on their ecological literacy and planetary stewardship actions.

**Why this could be interesting for LPI:**

1. **Complements Ikigai+**: Students find their purpose (via your tool) → take embodied action for the planet (via Cursive)
2. **UNESCO relevance**: Evidence-based methods for SDG education that you could showcase
3. **Minimal lift**: I'd handle research design, implementation, assessment—LPI provides student access and institutional credibility
4. **Open source**: Everything we create (toolkit, research) would be freely available under Creative Commons for LPI to use ongoing

**What I'm asking:**

Would LPI be open to being named as the institutional partner in the proposal? I don't need a formal letter tonight (deadline is too tight), but I'd love to know:

1. Is this concept aligned with LPI's priorities enough that you'd be open to exploring it if funded?
2. Could you confirm you'd be willing to help with student recruitment and curriculum integration if the grant comes through?
3. Any red flags or concerns I should know about?

**What's in it for the grant (why it helps our case):**

- I'm LPI alumni (Masters 2021) ✓
- I spoke with François two weeks ago about educational innovation ✓
- You're the institutional champion who knows how to integrate this ✓
- LPI's UNESCO connection = scalability to 200+ institutions ✓

**Timeline:**
- Proposal due: Tonight (Nov 19, 2025)
- If funded: Project would start ~April 2026
- Commitment: 40-50 students over 12 months, minimal educator time (I'd handle most logistics)

**Grant details:**
- $20,000 for 1 year (Level I)
- Focus: Planetary Health education
- Deliverable: Open toolkit any educator can use + research paper on embodied learning effectiveness

I know this is last-minute (I just finalized the concept today after our conversations!). Even a quick "yes, this is aligned" or "no, this doesn't fit right now" would help me know whether to submit.

**Would a quick 15-minute call help? I'm available anytime in the next few hours.**

Otherwise, even a short email response would be hugely helpful:

*"Hi Bilal, yes, this concept aligns with LPI's mission. If funded, I'd be happy to help with student recruitment and curriculum integration. Go ahead and name LPI as the institutional partner."*

Or:

*"Hi Bilal, interesting concept but [reason it doesn't fit]. I'd suggest [alternative approach]."*

Thank you for considering, and no pressure if the timing doesn't work!

Warmly,
Bilal

**P.S.** I've attached:
- Draft proposal (full application)
- Sample geocached prompt (what students would experience)
- One-page project summary

Feel free to share with François or others if helpful for internal discussion.

## ATTACHMENTS TO SEND

1. **NATGEO_APPLICATION_DRAFT.md** (full proposal)
2. **SAMPLE_GEOCACHED_PROMPT.md** (example activity)
3. **ONE_PAGER.md** (to create - see below)

## ALTERNATIVE: Shorter, More Casual Email (if you have good rapport)

**Subject**: Nat Geo proposal - quick LPI partnership question?

---

Hey Pascal,

Quick one: I'm submitting a Nat Geo education grant tonight ($20K) to pilot Cursive with LPI students—testing whether place-based learning (geocached prompts around Paris ecology) leads to stronger environmental action than screen-only learning.

**Would LPI be open to being the institutional partner?**

What I need from you:
- Student recruitment help (40-50 volunteers)
- Institutional endorsement
- Help integrating into curriculum where it fits

What you get:
- Research on embodied learning effectiveness (publishable through LPI's UNESCO network)
- Open-source toolkit for planetary health education
- Potential Cursive-Ikigai+ integration (purpose-finding → embodied action)

I know it's last-minute, but even a "yes, aligned" or "no, not right now" helps me decide whether to submit.

Call if easier? Available next few hours.

Thanks!
Bilal

## NOTES FOR BILAL

**Before sending, customize:**

1. **Tone**: Choose whichever email style matches your relationship with Pascal (formal vs. casual)

2. **Timing**: Since it's due tonight, consider:
   - Calling him directly if you have his number
   - Sending WhatsApp/Signal if you communicate that way
   - Email as backup

3. **Attachments**: Consider creating a simple one-pager (see next section) to make it scannable

4. **Follow-up**: If he says yes, you can formalize partnership agreement later; for tonight's submission, just need his verbal/email okay

5. **If he says no or doesn't respond**: You can still submit the proposal explaining "partnership in discussion phase" since you DID talk to François recently and this IS aligned with LPI's mission. Nat Geo understands partnerships take time to formalize.

---

## IF PASCAL SAYS NO OR DOESN'T RESPOND IN TIME

**Alternative framing for the application:**

"Partnership in Development: The Principal Investigator is an LPI alumnus (Masters 2021) with recent discussions with Chief Exploration Officer François Taddei about this project concept. While formal partnership agreements are pending, preliminary conversations indicate strong alignment with LPI's mission to train SDG changemakers through innovative pedagogy. If funded, the project would formalize institutional partnership through an MOU and recruit LPI students and educators through established channels."

This is honest, doesn't overstate the relationship, and Nat Geo understands that partnerships develop over time—especially when dealing with universities and bureaucracy.

**Good luck! Let me know what Pascal says and I can help adjust the application accordingly.**
