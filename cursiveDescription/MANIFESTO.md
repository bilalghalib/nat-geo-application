# The Cursive Manifesto

**Software for human hands and hearts.**

---

## What Cursive Is

You write with ink on digital paper. Your process—the pauses, corrections, and deliberate strokes—creates an unfakeable fingerprint proving you made this.

Teachers assign work with embedded assessments. Students see exactly what's measured and why. Routes adapt to understanding, not just scores.

Hosts facilitate groups on human rhythms. Software reminds when to release prompts but never replaces the facilitator.

Everything exports. Your pages, your data, your badges—truly owned, cryptographically yours.

This is the alternative to the hostile web.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

The modern internet optimizes for engagement, not depth. It treats your attention as inventory to be captured and monetized. It automates away the friction that creates meaning.

We choose differently.

We believe that:
- **Depth beats velocity** - Some things deserve sustained attention
- **Process matters as much as output** - How you made it is part of what it means
- **Humans should guide, AI should assist** - The craftsperson holds the tool
- **Beauty should be calm, not stimulating** - Aesthetics can create space for thought
- **Your work should be yours** - Truly owned, fully exportable, cryptographically verifiable

---

## Our Core Commitments

### 1. Pages Are Sacred

Your journal is yours alone—no AI ever writes in it.

**What this means:**
- Content comes from human hands: typing, handwriting, drawing
- AI suggestions appear as whispers in margins, never auto-applied
- Every change requires human intention and action
- "Origin flags" track what's human-authored vs. suggested
- Automated writes are prohibited by design

**Why it matters:**
Your page is proof of your thinking. When you share work, others know it's authentically yours.

---

### 2. Process Is the Proof

Stroke timing, idle pauses, and error patterns create unfakeable fingerprints of human work.

**What this means:**
- Background recording captures how you create (not just what)
- Fingerprint algorithm detects human patterns AI can't fake
- Session playback shows your creation process
- Verification badges certify craft, not just outcomes
- Teachers/reviewers see both product and process

**Why it matters:**
In an age of AI-generated everything, process is the new authenticity. Your work carries proof it's yours.

---

### 3. Assessment Serves Learning, Not Sorting

Rubrics are authored alongside content, not bolted on later. Students see the logic, understand the measures, and can contest with reasoning.

**What this means (SAREC framework):**
- Rubrics created during content authoring (not after)
- Evidence is transparent: you see what's measured and why
- Routes adapt to understanding, not just scores
- Confidence scores show uncertainty, not false precision
- Students can challenge assessments with their reasoning
- Teachers calibrate rubrics against sample work before deploying

**Why it matters:**
Assessment should scaffold learning, not gatekeep it. When you understand what's measured and why, evaluation becomes a learning conversation.

---

### 4. AI as Apprentice, Never Author

Tools appear as whispers in margins, never in the page. Every suggestion shows reasoning and confidence. Humans ratify; AI never auto-applies.

**What this means:**
- LLMs scaffold understanding, don't replace thinking
- Suggestion + ratification pattern (never auto-accept)
- All AI output includes confidence scores and reasoning
- Tools help structure freeform input (multi-select from essay)
- Process beats output: learning matters more than answers

**Why it matters:**
AI should make you more competent, not more dependent. Competence requires doing the work yourself, with scaffolding that fades.

---

### 5. Hosts Guide on Human Rhythms

Software reminds and prepares; humans release. Hosts can pause, skip weeks, or go off-script. The software never sends on your behalf.

**What this means:**
- Human hosts required for group experiences
- Software prepares releases, humans approve sending
- Email/SMS responders extend host capacity (but don't replace)
- Hosts can pause cohorts (vacations, illness)
- Facilitation is a human relationship, not automation

**Why it matters:**
Hospitality requires presence. When you receive an invitation, a real person sent it at a deliberate moment.

---

### 6. Beauty Is Not Decoration

Japanese woodworking aesthetic: minimal, precise, functional. Stone colors, not attention-grabbing primaries. Calm is designed, not accidental.

**What this means:**
- 2px corners, not rounded everything
- No animations, transitions, or "delight" micro-interactions
- Typography and white space create hierarchy
- Stone colors (warm grays, soft earth tones)
- Deliberate friction: page edges, finite sheets, visible boundaries

**Why it matters:**
Beauty creates space for thought. When interfaces are calm, your attention stays on your work, not the tool.

---

### 7. Pages Have Edges

Documents end at 297mm, like real paper. Overflow creates new sheets, not infinite scroll. Digital can learn from physical constraints.

**What this means:**
- A4 page size (210mm × 297mm) as default canvas
- Page breaks create rhythm and decision points
- Adding sheets requires intention (anti-infinite-scroll)
- Pagination helps you gauge scope and plan work
- Fixed-size surfaces encourage deliberate expansion

**Why it matters:**
Constraints create craft. When you know the page ends, you compose differently. Boundaries are features, not limitations.

---

### 8. Everything You Make Is Yours

Export to `.cursive` archives with full provenance. Verification badges you truly own (cryptographically, not just "displayed on profile").

**What this means:**
- Complete export: pages, metadata, fingerprints, badges
- Provenance receipts travel with your work
- Quorum proofs (group achievements) cryptographically signed
- Import into any Cursive-compatible tool
- No lock-in, ever

**Why it matters:**
True ownership means leaving is always possible. If you don't like our choices, take your work elsewhere.

---

## From Values to Design

**How philosophy becomes features:**

### Value: Qualitative Perception
→ **Design:** Process visibility, stroke-level recording, time-on-task tracking
→ **Feature:** Verification badges celebrate craft and sustained effort, not just correct answers

### Value: Embodied Cognition
→ **Design:** Pen-first interface, GPS context, photo prompts
→ **Feature:** "Look Up" tool identifies trees around you; drawing is a first-class citizen

### Value: Competence over Automation
→ **Design:** Suggestion + ratification pattern, confidence scores, contestable assessments
→ **Feature:** SAREC shows rubric logic transparently; students can say "I actually did understand this"

### Value: Hospitality over Hostility
→ **Design:** Human hosts required, software reminds only, email-based releases
→ **Feature:** Hosts can pause/resume cycles for vacations; no auto-sending without approval

### Value: Verifiable Craft
→ **Design:** Background session recording, fingerprint algorithm
→ **Feature:** Unfakeable proof-of-human via stroke variance, idle patterns, revision sequences

### Value: Sovereignty
→ **Design:** `.cursive` export format, cryptographic signatures
→ **Feature:** Take your work, badges, and provenance anywhere; import into compatible tools

---

## What We Refuse to Build

Some features are popular but antithetical to our values. We will not build:

- ❌ **Algorithmic feeds** that optimize for time-on-site
- ❌ **Notification badges** fighting for attention
- ❌ **Infinite scroll** removing natural stopping points
- ❌ **Gamification** creating false urgency (streaks, leaderboards)
- ❌ **Auto-posting** or scheduled AI responses
- ❌ **Engagement analytics** visible to users
- ❌ **Growth hacking** features of any kind
- ❌ **Dark patterns** of any form
- ❌ **Attention capture** mechanisms
- ❌ **AI auto-apply** (ever)

If something makes the tool more "sticky" at the cost of user agency, we don't build it.

---

## Who This Is For

### Students & Learners
You deserve tools that make you more capable, not more dependent. Cursive scaffolds understanding without doing the work for you. Your process is visible proof of your learning.

### Teachers & Facilitators
You need assessment tools that don't require becoming data scientists. SAREC lets you author rubrics alongside content, see process alongside product, and maintain human-centered facilitation at scale.

### Writers & Creators
You want a journal that's truly yours—no AI polluting your thinking space. Export everything, own your process, share your craft with proof it's authentically yours.

### Groups & Cohorts
You need rhythms that respect human presence. Hosts guide, software supports, and nobody gets automated communications pretending to be personal.

---

## What Success Looks Like

We'll know Cursive works when:

1. **Students contest assessments with reasoning** - Not just "I think this is wrong," but "Here's why my approach demonstrates understanding."

2. **Teachers author rubrics during content creation** - Assessment feels native, not bolted-on.

3. **Process fingerprints become standard proof** - Sharing work includes sharing how you made it.

4. **Hosts facilitate without burnout** - Software reminds and prepares; hosts remain present.

5. **Exports are common** - People take their work elsewhere, and that's celebrated.

6. **Calm is the default experience** - No one describes Cursive as "engaging" or "addictive."

---

## Technical Philosophy

### Protocol vs. Implementation

**Protocol** = Export format (how work travels between tools)
**Implementation** = Our reference app (one way to honor these values)

The protocol ensures your work is portable. Our implementation shows one way to build for these values. Others can build different implementations that respect the same commitments.

### Open Core, Open Values

- The protocol spec is open (MIT license)
- The reference implementation may stay closed
- The values are universal: any tool can adopt them
- `.cursive` archives let you leave anytime

---

## The Alternative Web

The hostile web:
- Optimizes for engagement over depth
- Treats humans as inventory (attention to monetize)
- Uses dark patterns to capture time
- Makes AI replace rather than scaffold
- Locks you in with proprietary formats

The alternative (Cursive):
- Optimizes for depth over velocity
- Treats humans as craftspeople
- Uses deliberate friction to create meaning
- Makes AI assist rather than replace
- Gives you full ownership and portability

---

## A Manifesto, Not a Business Plan

This document describes what we believe, not what's profitable. Some of these choices limit growth. That's intentional.

We'd rather build for depth than scale, for craft than convenience, for sovereignty than stickiness.

If you want another engagement-optimized platform, dozens exist. If you want software that treats you as a craftsperson with agency, we're building it.
