# The Cursive Values

**Last Updated:** October 29, 2025
**Purpose:** To define the philosophical foundation of the Cursive Protocol

---

## Preamble: Reintegrating the Human Heart

Cursive is a quiet stand for humanity on the internet. It rejects the post-Cartesian split that severed mind from body, reason from feeling, objective from subjective. We believe that true knowing is qualitative, embodied, and felt—not just measured and analyzed.

This is software for the human heart. It creates space for:
- **Awe** - The feeling when we witness someone's genuine craft
- **Pride** - The satisfaction of working hard on something beautiful
- **Depth** - The productive friction that comes from sitting with difficulty
- **Connection** - The recognition that comes from truly seeing another's work

We use modern technology not to optimize away the human experience, but to amplify and celebrate it.

## The Six Core Values

### 1. Qualitative Perception & The Human Heart

**Core Idea:** There are ways of knowing that cannot be reduced to data. Beauty, meaning, connection, and understanding are felt realities that precede and transcend measurement. The system must honor qualitative experience as a legitimate form of knowledge.

**How This Value Speaks:**
> "...productive friction, helping people make time/space to really enjoy the beauty of human connection and depth and working hard on something and being proud of the work and craft and seeing other people's work/effort and being in awe..."

**Implications for the Protocol:**
- The protocol must have primitives for expressing and preserving qualitative dimensions: beauty, effort, meaning, connection
- Metrics exist to serve understanding, never to replace felt experience
- The system deliberately creates "productive friction" - moments that require patience, care, and sustained attention
- Features are designed to help people notice and appreciate the texture of human work: the hesitation in a drawing, the revision history of a thought, the care in a response
- Success is measured not in engagement metrics but in reported depth of experience and quality of connection

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Reducing human experience to quantifiable metrics (likes, followers, engagement scores)
- Optimizing for speed and efficiency over depth and meaning
- Treating all content as equivalent "data" regardless of its human context
- Gamification that manipulates behavior rather than supporting intrinsic motivation

### 2. Embodied & Situated Knowing

**Core Idea:** True understanding is not abstract or disembodied. It is rooted in our physical bodies, our senses, and the specific places we inhabit. The digital tool must honor and connect with the physical world, not replace it.

**How This Value Speaks:**
> "...connecting people to their qualitative perspectives, connecting to place (GPS, looking around you, a tool that allows you to upload a photo of a leaf to know what kind of trees are growing nearby, etc) and to the body, using a pen, drawing..."

**Implications for the Protocol:**
- The protocol must support sensory input: location, images, audio, physical gestures
- The page metaphor respects the haptic reality of paper - it has size, texture, resistance
- Drawing with a pen is a first-class citizen, not a secondary feature
- Tools can connect writing to place: what trees surround you, what season is it, where are you sitting
- The system assumes users are whole people in real places, not disembodied "users"

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Assuming all interaction happens at a desk on a large screen
- Treating physical context as "metadata" rather than essential information
- Making handwriting/drawing second-class to typing
- Creating experiences that require sustained screen attention at the expense of being present in place

### 3. Apprenticeship & Mastery (Competence over Automation)

**Core Idea:** Technology should function as a master craftsperson's tool, designed to help an apprentice gain competence. It scaffolds skill, it doesn't automate it away. Its purpose is to make the user better, not to make itself indispensable.

**How This Value Speaks:**
> "...the idea that the LLM doesn't DO anything for you, it helps you gain competence not decays it... people can talk freeform and the LLMs can help provide a structured answer (multi/single select, number, etc) without making the person a button presser, they can share freely..."

**Implications for the Protocol:**
- AI interactions must be designed as learning opportunities, not shortcuts
- The protocol favors "suggestion and ratification" over "generation and acceptance"
- The system tracks the user's engagement with the process as a measure of growing skill
- Complexity is revealed progressively - beginners get scaffolding, masters get full control
- Every automated assistance must have a manual override that teaches the underlying skill

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- AI that completes tasks without user involvement (e.g., "write this essay for me")
- Hiding complexity in ways that prevent understanding
- Creating dependency on the tool rather than building user capability
- Optimizing for quick results over deep learning

### 4. Gardens, Not Battlefields (Hospitality over Hostility)

**Core Idea:** The digital world should be a cultivated space for growth, reflection, and connection—a garden—not a battlefield for attention. This requires human tending, deliberate paths, and a rejection of algorithmic manipulation.

**How This Value Speaks:**
> "...hospitality (courses are together, hosts //must// send you the prompts on schedule, the tool just reminds them when to send it)... we want to create a calm, connecting publishing platform where we can show ourselves as one of the last stands for humanity on the internet, webrings not algorithmic... we recognize in the background - not as a way to manipulate people into behaviors (badges)..."

**Implications for the Protocol:**
- The protocol must prioritize human-curated connections over machine-generated feeds
- It must have primitives for "hosting" and "guiding" that empower human facilitators
- The system operates on human rhythms, not algorithmic optimization for engagement
- Recognition exists to honor genuine accomplishment, never to manipulate behavior
- Connections happen through deliberate invitation (webrings), not opaque algorithms

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Infinite scroll, autoplay, or other engagement-maximizing dark patterns
- Algorithmic feeds that optimize for attention capture
- Gamification designed to create addiction (streaks, points, leaderboards)
- Automated notifications that interrupt flow
- Making human facilitators optional or replaceable by automation

### 5. Authenticity & Verifiable Craft (Process as Proof)

**Core Idea:** In an age of effortless digital reproduction, the process of human creation—with all its effort, messiness, and intention—is a precious and verifiable act. The system must be able to distinguish and celebrate authentic human work.

**How This Value Speaks:**
> "...we don't allow pasting without provenance/citation and maybe no images unless you drew them yourself... making it so you do your work out loud, in public, sharing your page/process... proof-ish of human (save stroke count/monitor for human patterns and personal fingerprints)..."

**Implications for the Protocol:**
- The protocol must be a high-fidelity recorder of the creative act
- It needs primitives for provenance, citation, and process_metadata (stroke data, edit history, time spent)
- The system defines what constitutes a "proof-of-human" signature
- Content created by AI must be clearly marked and cited
- The process of creation is as valuable as the final artifact
- Users can choose to share their "making-of" as evidence of authentic work

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Allowing uncited copying or pasting from external sources
- Treating AI-generated and human-generated content as equivalent
- Hiding the process and only showing polished final products
- Making it easy to falsely claim work as one's own
- Optimizing for productivity at the expense of genuine craft

### 6. Sovereignty & Durability (True Ownership)

**Core Idea:** A person's thoughts, identity, and reputation are their own. They must be cryptographically owned, truly portable, and durable enough to outlive any single platform. The protocol, not the platform, is the guarantee.

**How This Value Speaks:**
> "...encrypted profiles where badges are truly owned by people and exportable off the system... all this must be exportable and transposable to other systems operating by the same protocol, the protocol must encode the values..."

**Implications for the Protocol:**
- The protocol is the ultimate guarantor of user sovereignty
- It must define data structures not just for content, but for verifiable credentials, reputation, and identity
- All user data must be exportable in a clean, documented format
- The protocol must be built on open, durable standards (not proprietary formats)
- A user must be able to pack up their entire digital self and move elsewhere
- The protocol itself must encode these values so that any compliant implementation respects them

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Proprietary data formats that lock users in
- Making export difficult, incomplete, or lossy
- Claiming ownership over user-generated content
- Building features that only work within the platform ecosystem
- Using network effects to trap users rather than serve them

## Living These Values: Design Principles

Every feature, every decision, every line of code must be judged against these values. When in doubt, ask:

1. **Does this honor the qualitative, felt experience?** Or does it reduce humanity to metrics?
2. **Does this connect people to their bodies and places?** Or does it further disembodiment?
3. **Does this help users gain competence?** Or does it create dependency?
4. **Does this create a cultivated garden?** Or does it exploit attention?
5. **Does this honor authentic craft?** Or does it enable easy forgery?
6. **Does this ensure sovereignty?** Or does it trap users?

If a feature violates any of these values, we either redesign it or we don't build it.

## The Promise

We promise to build technology that:
- Respects the human heart and qualitative knowing
- Honors the body and the physical world
- Helps people grow in skill and understanding
- Creates calm, hospitable spaces for connection
- Celebrates authentic human effort
- Ensures lasting ownership and portability

This is the Cursive Protocol. This is our stand for humanity on the internet.
