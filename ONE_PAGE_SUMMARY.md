# PLACE-BASED LEARNING FOR PLANETARY STEWARDSHIP
## National Geographic Society Grant Proposal - One-Page Summary

---

### THE PROBLEM

Students learning about planetary health spend most of their time at screens, disconnected from the environments they're learning to protect. Research shows environmental stewardship develops through direct sensory experience—yet educational technology rarely supports embodied engagement with place.

---

### THE SOLUTION

**Pilot Cursive** (open-source embodied learning protocol) with **Learning Planet Institute** students in Paris to test whether place-based, geocached learning activities lead to stronger environmental awareness and action compared to traditional screen-based education.

**How it works:**
- Students receive geocached prompts that unlock at specific Paris locations (Seine River, urban parks, biodiversity sites)
- Each prompt guides observation, reflection, and action related to planetary health
- Educators provide correspondence/feedback, creating ongoing dialogue
- Comparative study: embodied cohort vs. digital-only control group

---

### THE PARTNERSHIP

**Learning Planet Institute** (Paris)
- UNESCO Chair in Learning Sciences
- Co-created UNESCO Learning Planet Alliance (200+ institutions)
- Training SDG changemakers through innovative pedagogy

**Bilal Ghalib** (Project Lead)
- LPI alumnus (Masters 2021 in Learning Sciences)
- 15 years designing wellbeing-centered education programs (16 countries, 933 enterprises)
- Recent conversations with François Taddei (LPI Founder) and Pascal Kolbe (Ikigai+ Product Manager)
- Based in France (Lille), fluent Arabic/English, conversational French

---

### THE INNOVATION

**What makes this different:**
✓ First formal test of geocached learning for planetary education
✓ Open-source toolkit any educator globally can adapt (Creative Commons)
✓ Low-resource model (no expensive equipment or platforms)
✓ Balances technology with embodied experience (correspondence, not gamification)
✓ Built-in scalability through UNESCO network

**Alignment with Nat Geo priorities:**
✓ Connects skills to planetary action (not tech for tech's sake)
✓ Identified learners (40-50 LPI students)
✓ Clear learning outcomes (environmental awareness + documented actions)
✓ Focus Area: **Planetary Health**
✓ Sustainable design (toolkit persists beyond grant period)

---

### THE OUTCOMES

**Goal 1: Measure Impact**
- 60%+ increase in environmental awareness (embodied vs. control)
- 80%+ complete minimum 3 place-based activities
- Documented environmental actions (individual + collective)

**Goal 2: Create Replicable Methods**
- Open-source educator toolkit (prompts, facilitation guides, assessments)
- Translations: English, French, Arabic
- 10+ institutions express interest in piloting

**Goal 3: Build Evidence Base**
- Research paper submitted to peer-reviewed journal
- Presented at UNESCO Learning Planet Festival 2027
- Policy brief for educational institutions

---

### THE TIMELINE

**12 Months | April 2026 - March 2027**

- **Months 1-3**: Co-design with LPI educators, create prompts, recruit students
- **Months 3-9**: Implementation (2 prompts/month), data collection, continuous iteration
- **Months 9-11**: Analysis, toolkit refinement, research writing
- **Months 11-12**: Dissemination (conferences, publications, open toolkit release)

---

### THE BUDGET

**Level I: $20,000**

- **60%** Personnel (lead investigator, research assistant, ecology consultant)
- **10%** Research & assessment (instruments, translation, ethics compliance)
- **7.5%** Technology (platform hosting, development, support)
- **7.5%** Student & educator support (transportation equity, stipends, recognition)
- **10%** Dissemination (conferences, open-access publishing, video documentary)
- **5%** Partnership, community engagement, contingency

**Efficiency factors:**
- Leverages LPI's existing infrastructure (no overhead costs)
- Local context (no international travel)
- Open-source approach (builds on existing Cursive development)
- Partnership model (educators contribute as professional development)

---

### THE IMPACT MULTIPLIER

**Direct**: 40-50 students and educators
**Institutional**: Learning Planet Institute integrates into ongoing curriculum
**Network**: 200+ UNESCO institutions can adopt toolkit
**Global**: Any educator worldwide can use methods (open access, translated)
**Research**: Evidence base for embodied learning in planetary education

---

### SAMPLE ACTIVITY

**Prompt: "The Seine's Hidden Life"**
- **Location**: Pont de la Tournelle (geocached)
- **Activity**: Observe river for 5 minutes, document biodiversity, investigate water quality indicators
- **Reflection**: How do rivers recover from pollution? What role can I play in water health?
- **Action**: Commit to one water-related action this week
- **Correspondence**: Educator responds with feedback and connections to other students' observations

---

### WHY THIS MATTERS NOW

1. **UNESCO's 2024 framework** emphasizes experiential learning for sustainability
2. **Post-pandemic reconsideration** of screen time in education
3. **Paris urban biodiversity initiatives** where student participation amplifies impact
4. **Critical gap** between knowing about planetary health and taking action

---

### SUSTAINABILITY BEYOND GRANT

- Toolkit remains freely accessible in perpetuity (Creative Commons)
- LPI continues using methods in curriculum
- Research paper citable by future researchers
- Platform code open-sourced (GitHub, MIT License)
- Educator community continues through UNESCO network
- Potential Level II funding to scale to multiple geographies
