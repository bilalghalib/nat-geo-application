OUTREACH SCRIPT FOR: Keren Makari - The Smart Sensory

Opening:
"Hi Keren, it's David from Bloom. I've been reviewing our interview from 9 Sept and wanted to share something exciting with you..."

Hook:
You mentioned seeking partnerships during your ACSI interview - we've identified 8 teams in similar sectors who could collaborate

Value Proposition:
"We're bringing together the 1011 teams we've trained into a cooperative structure where we're stronger together. Here's what this means for The Smart Sensory:"

Specific Benefits:
• Joint clinical validation studies
• Shared relationships with hospitals/clinics
• Collective impact measurement
• Shared back-office services (accounting, legal, HR) at 30-40% savings

Sector-Specific Angle:
Healthcare impact collective

Call to Action:
"Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore this? I think there are some specific partnerships that could accelerate The Smart Sensory's growth."

Follow-up:
"I'll send over a one-pager on the cooperative structure and some initial ideas for The Smart Sensory."
