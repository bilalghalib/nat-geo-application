Opening:
"Hi Iman, it's David from Bloom. I've been reviewing our interview from 5 Sept and wanted to share something exciting with you..."

Hook:
You mentioned seeking partnerships during your ACSI interview - we've identified 8 teams in similar sectors who could collaborate

Value Proposition:
"We're bringing together the 1011 teams we've trained into a cooperative structure where we're stronger together. Here's what this means for Hazel Farm:"

Specific Benefits:
• Access to shared educational content library
• Collective bargaining with school systems
• Joint marketing to reduce customer acquisition costs
• Shared back-office services (accounting, legal, HR) at 30-40% savings

Sector-Specific Angle:
Educational ecosystem collaboration

Call to Action:
"Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore this? I think there are some specific partnerships that could accelerate Hazel Farm's growth."

Follow-up:
"I'll send over a one-pager on the cooperative structure and some initial ideas for Hazel Farm."
