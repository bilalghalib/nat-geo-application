# Bloom Cooperative: Financial Infrastructure Model
**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Purpose**: Model cooperative formation and operational costs to determine sustainable pricing

---

## Executive Summary

**The Question**: What does it cost to RUN a cooperative with 20/50/100 members?

**The Answer**:
- **20 members**: $35-45K/year → $145-187/month per member
- **50 members**: $55-75K/year → $92-125/month per member
- **100 members**: $85-115K/year → $71-96/month per member

**Implication**: Even a "low-pay" solidarity circle ($25/month) needs **80+ members** to break even, OR external revenue (grants/Track 2 investment income).

## Part 1: Cooperative Formation Costs (One-Time)

### **Legal Entity Formation**

| Item | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Legal structure research** | $0 - $2,000 | Depends on jurisdiction (Lebanon? US? Multi-national?) |
| **Cooperative registration** | $500 - $5,000 | Varies by country. Lebanon = cheaper. US LLC with co-op bylaws = $1-2K |
| **Bylaws + governance docs** | $2,000 - $8,000 | Lawyer to draft cooperative bylaws, membership agreements, governance structure |
| **Multi-jurisdictional setup** | $5,000 - $15,000 | If serving MENA (Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Palestine) - need legal in each country OR neutral jurisdiction |
| **Revenue-share contracts** | $3,000 - $10,000 | Legal templates for Track 2 (2-5% revenue share agreements) |
| **Payment processor setup** | $500 - $2,000 | Stripe Atlas + MENA payment solutions (Telr, PayTabs, Fawry for Egypt) |

**Total Formation Costs**: $11,000 - $42,000

**Recommended approach**:
- **Minimum**: $12,000 (US LLC with cooperative bylaws + basic payment setup)
- **Optimal**: $25,000 (Multi-jurisdictional consideration + MENA payment rails)

---

### **Platform & Infrastructure (One-Time Setup)**

| Item | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Website + branding** | $2,000 - $8,000 | Arabic + English site, cooperative identity, member portal |
| **Payment infrastructure** | $1,000 - $3,000 | Integration of Stripe (global) + MENA solutions (Egypt, Lebanon, Palestine) |
| **Member management system** | $500 - $3,000 | CRM for 100+ members (Airtable paid, or custom build) |
| **Video conferencing (annual)** | $300 - $1,200 | Zoom Pro or Arabic-capable alternative |
| **Async collaboration platform** | $0 - $1,500 | Discord (free) or Mighty Networks ($500-1500/year) |

**Total Platform Costs**: $3,800 - $16,700

**Recommended**: $8,000 (professional but lean)

---

### **TOTAL ONE-TIME STARTUP COSTS**

| Scenario | Legal + Platform | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Lean Launch** | $20,000 | US entity, basic platform, DIY where possible |
| **Standard Launch** | $35,000 | Proper legal structure, professional platform |
| **Full-Scale Launch** | $60,000 | Multi-jurisdictional, custom platform, Arabic-first design |

**Recommended**: $35,000 for proper foundation

---

## Part 2: Annual Operational Costs

### **Team Costs (Annual)**

Cooperative needs **minimum viable team** to function:

| Role | Hours/Week | Annual Cost | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Cooperative Coordinator** | 20-30 hrs/week | $30,000 - $60,000 | Program management, member support, operations. Could be part-time initially. |
| **Facilitator (Track 1)** | 10 hrs/week | $15,000 - $30,000 | Lead solidarity circles, wellbeing protocols. Could be Bilal initially. |
| **Accountant/Bookkeeper** | 5-10 hrs/month | $6,000 - $15,000 | Financial tracking, revenue-share calculations (Track 2), compliance, tax filing |
| **Legal counsel (retainer)** | As-needed | $3,000 - $8,000 | Annual retainer for contract review, compliance, dispute resolution |
| **Tech support** | 5 hrs/month | $2,000 - $6,000 | Platform maintenance, payment debugging, member tech support |

**Total Team Costs**: $56,000 - $119,000/year

**Cost-saving strategies**:
- Bilal as Coordinator + Facilitator Year 1 = $45K instead of $90K
- Bookkeeper instead of full accountant = $6K instead of $15K
- Volunteer legal (pro bono) or defer until needed = $0 instead of $8K
- DIY tech support = $0 instead of $6K

**Lean Team (Year 1)**: $51,000
- Bilal (Coordinator + Facilitator): $45,000
- Bookkeeper: $6,000
- Legal/Tech: As-needed, ~$3K contingency

---

### **Platform & Infrastructure (Annual Recurring)**

| Item | Annual Cost | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Website hosting** | $200 - $500 | Cloud hosting (Vercel, Netlify, or DigitalOcean) |
| **Payment processing fees** | $500 - $5,000 | 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. Depends on volume. |
| **Member management CRM** | $600 - $2,400 | Airtable Pro ($20/mo) or custom solution |
| **Video conferencing** | $300 - $1,200 | Zoom Pro or alternative |

| **Accounting software** | $300 - $1,000 | QuickBooks or Xero for cooperative accounting |
| **Insurance** | $1,000 - $3,000 | Liability insurance for cooperative (recommended) |

**Total Platform (Annual)**: $2,900 - $14,600

**Recommended**: $5,000/year (mid-range, professional)

---

### **Program & Operations (Annual)**

| Item | Annual Cost | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Track 1: Solidarity Circle stipends** | $3,000 - $10,000 | Guest facilitators, materials, translation costs (Arabic protocols) |
| **Track 2: Due diligence costs** | $2,000 - $5,000 | Revenue verification, financial audits for investment track |
| **Governance & retreats** | $5,000 - $15,000 | Annual general assembly, member gatherings (travel, venue, food for MENA participants) |
| **Learning & development** | $2,000 - $5,000 | Training for cooperative governance, facilitator development |
| **Contingency fund** | $5,000 - $10,000 | Crisis support, emergency member needs, unforeseen costs |

**Total Program Costs**: $17,000 - $45,000

**Recommended**: $25,000 (includes meaningful gathering budget)

---

### **TOTAL ANNUAL OPERATING COSTS**

| Cost Category | Lean | Standard | Full-Scale |
|---------------|------|----------|-----------|
| **Team** | $51,000 | $70,000 | $119,000 |
| **Platform & Infrastructure** | $3,000 | $5,000 | $10,000 |
| **Program & Operations** | $17,000 | $25,000 | $40,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$71,000** | **$100,000** | **$169,000** |

---

## Part 3: Cost Per Member at Different Scales

### **Scenario A: 20 Members (Small Solidarity Circle)**

**Annual Costs**: $71,000 (lean) - $100,000 (standard)

**Cost per Member**: $3,550 - $5,000/year = **$296 - $417/month**

**Member Contribution Options**:
- **$25/month**: Covers only 8.4% of costs → need $65K external funding
- **$50/month**: Covers 17% → need $59K external funding
- **$100/month**: Covers 34% → need $47K external funding

**Implication**: At 20 members, solidarity circle CANNOT be self-sustaining even at $100/month. Requires grants or Track 2 revenue.

---

### **Scenario B: 50 Members (Medium Cooperative)**

**Annual Costs**: $85,000 (lean) - $115,000 (standard)
*Note: Some economies of scale (same coordinator can manage 50 vs 20), but add second facilitator*

**Cost per Member**: $1,700 - $2,300/year = **$142 - $192/month**

**Member Contribution Options**:
- **$25/month**: Covers 18% → need $70K external funding
- **$50/month**: Covers 35% → need $55K external funding
- **$100/month**: Covers 70% → need $25K external funding
- **$150/month**: Covers 100% → SELF-SUSTAINING

**Implication**: At 50 members × $150/month, cooperative can be fully self-sustaining. But $150/month is HIGH for "solidarity circle".

---

### **Scenario C: 100 Members (Large Cooperative)**

**Annual Costs**: $110,000 (lean) - $145,000 (standard)
*Note: Larger team needed (2 coordinators, 3 facilitators for 100 members), but infrastructure scales*

**Cost per Member**: $1,100 - $1,450/year = **$92 - $121/month**

**Member Contribution Options**:
- **$25/month**: Covers 27% → need $80K external funding
- **$50/month**: Covers 55% → need $50K external funding
- **$75/month**: Covers 82% → need $20K external funding
- **$100/month**: Covers 110% → SELF-SUSTAINING + $12K surplus

**Implication**: At 100 members × $100/month, cooperative is self-sustaining with small surplus. This is the **minimum viable scale** for pure membership model.

---

### **Scenario D: 200 Members (Scaled Cooperative)**

**Annual Costs**: $160,000 - $210,000
*Note: 3-4 coordinators, 5-6 facilitators, but significant economies of scale on platform/legal*

**Cost per Member**: $800 - $1,050/year = **$67 - $88/month**

**Member Contribution Options**:
- **$50/month**: Covers 71% → need $50K external funding
- **$75/month**: Covers 100% → SELF-SUSTAINING
- **$100/month**: Generates $80K surplus → can fund Track 2 capital pool OR subsidize crisis-affected members

**Implication**: At 200 members × $75/month, fully self-sustaining. At $100/month, generates surplus for investment track.

---

## Part 4: Blended Revenue Model (Track 1 + Track 2)

### **The Hybrid Approach**

**Track 1 (Solidarity Circle)**: 60 members × $25/month = $18,000/year
**Track 2 (Investment Cooperative)**: 10 members × 2.5% revenue share

#### **Track 2 Revenue Projections**

Assume 10 entrepreneurs in investment track, various revenue levels:

| Entrepreneur | Annual Revenue | 2.5% Share | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| Agonist Coffee | $200,000 | $5,000 | Stage 5.5, established |
| Bildits | $150,000 | $3,750 | Stage 5.5, tech-enabled |
| eFlow | $120,000 | $3,000 | Stage 5.2, seeking scale |
| L'artisan du liban | $180,000 | $4,500 | Stage 5.7, sustainable |
| Potion Kitchen | $100,000 | $2,500 | Stage 5.2, food & bev |
| RUSH & REEZ | $150,000 | $3,750 | Stage 5.7, sustainable |
| DonaLeb | $80,000 | $2,000 | Healthcare platform (estimate) |
| Virtual artboard | $90,000 | $2,250 | Design platform |
| PNIN | $60,000 | $1,500 | Jordan healthcare |
| Steelouette | $110,000 | $2,750 | Design, 15-person team |

**Total Track 2 Revenue**: $31,000/year

**Combined Revenue**:
- Track 1 (60 × $25): $18,000
- Track 2 (10 × avg): $31,000
- **TOTAL**: $49,000/year

**Operating Costs** (70 members total): ~$95,000/year

**Gap**: $46,000 → still need external funding OR increase Track 2 to 20 entrepreneurs ($62K → total $80K, gap only $15K)

---

### **Path to Self-Sustainability**

#### **Year 1: Heavy External Funding**
- 20 Track 1 members × $25 = $6,000
- 0 Track 2 members (building trust first)
- Operating costs: $71,000
- **External funding needed**: $65,000

#### **Year 2: Track 2 Launches**
- 40 Track 1 members × $25 = $12,000
- 6 Track 2 members × avg $3,100 = $18,600
- Operating costs: $85,000
- **External funding needed**: $54,400

#### **Year 3: Approaching Sustainability**
- 60 Track 1 members × $40 (price increase) = $28,800
- 15 Track 2 members × avg $3,100 = $46,500
- Operating costs: $105,000
- **Total revenue**: $75,300
- **External funding needed**: $29,700

#### **Year 4: Self-Sustaining**
- 80 Track 1 members × $50 = $48,000
- 25 Track 2 members × avg $3,100 = $77,500
- Operating costs: $125,000
- **Total revenue**: $125,500
- **SURPLUS**: $500 (break-even!)

#### **Year 5: Surplus for Growth**
- 100 Track 1 members × $60 = $72,000
- 35 Track 2 members × avg $3,100 = $108,500
- Operating costs: $145,000
- **Total revenue**: $180,500
- **SURPLUS**: $35,500 (can fund new initiatives, crisis support, expansion)

## Part 5: Payment Infrastructure Design

### **The Problem**: MENA Payment Complexity

**Challenge**: Members across Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Palestine need to pay $25-150/month
- **Lebanon**: Banking crisis, USD shortage, Whish Money or OMT only
- **Egypt**: Currency controls, local payment gateways (Fawry, Paymob)
- **Jordan**: Relatively stable, credit cards work
- **Palestine**: International sanctions, PayPal blocked, limited options

**Solution**: Multi-provider payment stack

---

### **Recommended Payment Stack**

#### **Layer 1: International Members (Diaspora, Stable Countries)**
- **Stripe**: Credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay
- **Fee**: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- **Coverage**: Global, works for Jordan, diaspora entrepreneurs

#### **Layer 2: Egypt**
- **Fawry**: Cash payments at kiosks, mobile wallets
- **Paymob**: Credit cards + mobile wallets (Vodafone Cash, etc.)
- **Fee**: 3-5% per transaction

#### **Layer 3: Lebanon**
- **Whish Money**: USD cash pickup at agents (workaround for banking crisis)
- **OMT**: Cash transfer service
- **Manual**: Bank transfer when possible (cheaper but slower)

#### **Layer 4: Palestine**
- **Manual invoicing**: Bank transfer or cash collection
- **Workaround**: Use Jordan-based payment processor for West Bank
- **Gaza**: Likely manual/cash only due to blockade

#### **Layer 5: Alternative (Crypto)**
- **USDC/USDT**: Stablecoins for members in crisis regions
- **Fee**: Network fees (low), but exchange to local currency is challenge
- **Use case**: Lebanon (USD shortage), Palestine (sanctions workaround)

---

### **Implementation Costs**

| Provider | Setup Cost | Monthly Fee | Transaction Fee | Coverage |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Stripe Atlas** | $500 | $0 | 2.9% + $0.30 | Global |
| **Fawry (Egypt)** | $1,000 | $50 | 3.5% | Egypt only |
| **Paymob (Egypt)** | $500 | $30 | 2.9% | Egypt only |
| **Whish Money (Lebanon)** | $0 (manual) | $0 | ~5% cash pickup | Lebanon |
| **Crypto wallet** | $0 | $0 | 0.5-2% network | Global |

**Total Setup**: $2,000
**Monthly Platform Fees**: $80
**Transaction Fees**: Average 3.5% across all providers

---

### **Designed for Track 1 → Track 2 Transition**

**Key principle**: Same payment infrastructure for both tracks

**Track 1 (Solidarity Circle)**:
- Collect $25/month via Stripe/Fawry/Whish
- Auto-renewing subscription
- Payment method stored for future

**Track 2 (Investment Cooperative)**:
- Same payment infrastructure
- Just change from fixed $25 → percentage-based (2-5% of revenue)
- Monthly revenue reporting form → auto-calculate payment due
- Payment collected via SAME stored payment method

**Transition experience**:
1. Member in Track 1 for 6 months, paying $25/month via Stripe
2. Business reaches revenue ($5K/month)
3. Invited to Track 2
4. Accepts → payment auto-switches to 2.5% × $5K = $125/month
5. SAME Stripe account, SAME payment method, just new calculation

**Technical requirement**: Build revenue reporting form + auto-calculation system
- **Cost**: $3,000 one-time development
- **Maintenance**: $500/year

---

## Part 6: Cooperative Legal Structure Options

### **Option 1: US-Based Worker Cooperative (Platform Co-op Model)**

**Structure**: Delaware LLC with cooperative bylaws
**Pros**:
- Easiest for international members (no local registration needed)
- US banking = access to Stripe, global payment rails
- Lower legal costs ($12-20K formation)
- Clear legal precedent (many US platform co-ops exist)

**Cons**:
- Tax complexity for non-US members
- May feel "colonial" (US entity serving MENA members)
- USD-denominated (currency risk for local members)

**Best for**: If majority members are diaspora or comfortable with US entity

---

### **Option 2: Lebanon-Based Cooperative**

**Structure**: Lebanese cooperative society (جمعية تعاونية)
**Pros**:
- Local presence, culturally aligned
- Arabic-first governance (natural)
- Lower formation costs ($2-5K in Lebanon)
- Easier for Lebanon members to pay (local banking)

**Cons**:
- Banking crisis = can't hold USD reliably
- Difficult for non-Lebanon members to join formally
- Limited international payment options
- Political/economic instability risk

**Best for**: If 80%+ members are Lebanon-based

---

### **Option 3: Multi-Stakeholder Cooperative (Hybrid)**

**Structure**: Umbrella US entity + local chapters (Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt)
**Pros**:
- Best of both worlds (global payments + local presence)
- Can tailor governance to each country's legal context
- Diaspora + local members all have pathway to ownership

**Cons**:
- Most complex legally ($40-60K formation)
- Higher annual compliance costs (multiple jurisdictions)
- Governance complexity (how do chapters coordinate?)

**Best for**: Long-term vision with 100+ members across multiple countries

---

### **Option 4: Fiscal Sponsorship First**

**Structure**: Operate under existing nonprofit as "project" for Year 1-2, then spin out
**Pros**:
- No formation costs initially ($0)
- Can accept grants immediately (nonprofit status)
- Test model before committing to legal structure
- Lower risk

**Cons**:
- Not true cooperative (sponsor owns it)
- Limited governance autonomy
- Track 2 revenue-share may not be allowed under nonprofit rules
- Need to transition eventually (spin-out costs $20-40K)

**Best for**: If unsure about model, want to test cheaply first

---

### **RECOMMENDED: Start with Option 4, Plan for Option 3**

**Year 1**: Fiscal sponsorship (find US or Lebanon nonprofit willing to host)
- Operate Track 1 solidarity circle as "program"
- Test governance, payment systems, member engagement
- Cost: $0 formation, just revenue share to sponsor (5-15% of grants)

**Year 2**: Form US LLC with co-op bylaws
- Use Year 1 learnings to design proper bylaws
- Launch Track 2 investment cooperative (needs independent entity)
- Cost: $20K formation

**Year 3+**: Expand to multi-stakeholder
- Add Lebanon chapter (for local members)
- Add Jordan/Egypt chapters as membership grows
- Cost: $20K per chapter

---

## Part 7: Minimum Funding Required (First 3 Years)

### **Path to Self-Sustainability: 3-Year Budget**

#### **YEAR 1: Foundation**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| **Formation** (Fiscal sponsorship) | $0 |
| **Payment infrastructure setup** | $2,000 |
| **Platform build** | $8,000 |
| **Operations** (lean team, 20 members) | $71,000 |
| **Track 1 revenue** (20 × $25 × 12) | -$6,000 |
| **Net external funding needed** | **$75,000** |

#### **YEAR 2: Track 2 Launch**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| **Formation** (US LLC with co-op bylaws) | $20,000 |
| **Track 2 legal** (revenue-share contracts) | $8,000 |
| **Track 2 capital pool** (6 entrepreneurs × $10K) | $60,000 |
| **Operations** (40 Track 1 + 6 Track 2 = 46 members) | $85,000 |
| **Track 1 revenue** (40 × $25 × 12) | -$12,000 |
| **Track 2 revenue** (6 × $3,100 avg) | -$18,600 |
| **Net external funding needed** | **$142,400** |

#### **YEAR 3: Scaling**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| **Operations** (60 Track 1 + 15 Track 2 = 75 members) | $105,000 |
| **Track 2 capital expansion** (9 new × $10K) | $90,000 |
| **Track 1 revenue** (60 × $40 × 12, price increase) | -$28,800 |
| **Track 2 revenue** (15 × $3,100 avg) | -$46,500 |
| **Net external funding needed** | **$119,700** |

---

### **TOTAL 3-YEAR FUNDING REQUIRED**

| Year | External Funding | Cumulative |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Year 1 | $75,000 | $75,000 |
| Year 2 | $142,400 | $217,400 |
| Year 3 | $119,700 | $337,100 |

**TOTAL**: $337,100 over 3 years to reach sustainability

**Year 4+**: Self-sustaining from member revenue (Track 1 + Track 2 combined)

---

## Part 8: Funding Strategy (How to Get $337K)

### **Funding Mix Recommendation**

#### **1. Grants (40% = $135K over 3 years)**
- **Year 1**: Apply for $50-75K foundation grant (Echoing Green, Ashoka, Open Society)
- **Year 2**: Apply for $50K cooperative development grant (US Federation of Worker Cooperatives, Cooperative Fund of NE)
- **Year 3**: Apply for $30K MENA-focused grant (Arab Foundations Forum, etc.)

#### **2. Impact Investment (40% = $135K)**
- **Year 2**: Raise $100K impact investment (convertible note or revenue-based financing)
  - Pitch: Fund Track 2 capital pool ($60K) + operations ($40K)
  - Return: 2X over 10 years from Track 2 revenue share
- **Year 3**: Raise $35K additional investment for expansion

#### **3. Personal/Founder Capital (10% = $34K)**
- **Year 1**: Bilal invests $20K personal funds (or defers salary)
- **Year 2**: Bilal invests $10K
- **Year 3**: $4K

#### **4. Earned Revenue (10% = $34K)**
- **Year 1**: Consulting/workshops to Bloom or others ($10K)
- **Year 2**: Consulting ($12K)
- **Year 3**: Consulting + speaking fees ($12K)

---

### **Alternative: Smaller, Slower Path**

If $337K feels too ambitious, here's a **$100K over 3 years** path:

**Changes**:
- Bilal works part-time on cooperative (50% time), defers $25K/year salary
- No Track 2 capital pool (just revenue-share model with 0% upfront capital)
- Slower growth (Year 1: 10 members, Year 2: 20 members, Year 3: 35 members)
- Lean operations (volunteer facilitators, DIY platform)

**3-Year Budget (Lean)**:
- Year 1: $30K (Bilal + platform)
- Year 2: $35K (Bilal + bookkeeper)
- Year 3: $35K
- **TOTAL**: $100K

**Funding sources**:
- Grants: $50K
- Personal investment: $30K (Bilal)
- Earned revenue: $20K (consulting)

**Tradeoff**: Takes 5 years to reach sustainability instead of 4 years, but much lower risk.

---

## Part 9: Decision Matrix

### **Key Questions to Answer**

| Question | If YES → | If NO → |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Can you raise $75K in Year 1? | Full-scale launch (20 members) | Lean launch (10 members) |
| Can you commit full-time? | Hire team, scale faster | Part-time, slower growth |
| Do you have $100K impact investors? | Track 2 capital pool Year 2 | Track 2 revenue-share only (no capital) |
| Is 100+ members the goal? | Multi-stakeholder co-op | Keep it small (US LLC) |
| Need it to be self-sustaining by Year 4? | Need full $337K funding | Slower path, 5-6 year horizon |

---

## Part 10: Pricing Recommendation for Track 1

### **The Math**:

You want:
- Islamic-inspired solidarity circle (values first)
- Low barrier ($25/month feels right)
- But need to transition smoothly to Track 2 (investment cooperative)
- AND build infrastructure early (payment systems, governance, legal entity)

**The problem**: $25/month × 20 members = $6K/year revenue, but costs are $71K/year = $65K gap

### **The Solution: Tiered Membership from Day 1**

**Tier 1: Solidarity (Values-driven, low-pay)**
- $25/month for pre-revenue entrepreneurs
- $50/month for early-revenue entrepreneurs ($1-10K/month)
- Focus: Peer support, wellbeing protocols, Arabic-first governance

**Tier 2: Investment (Capital-seeking, higher commitment)**
- 2% revenue share for entrepreneurs with $10-50K/month revenue
- 3% revenue share for entrepreneurs with $50K+/month revenue
- Access to capital pool ($5-15K injection), strategic support

**Tier 3: Stewardship (Alumni, paying it forward)**
- $100-500/month for successful entrepreneurs who "graduated"
- Governance role (board seats)
- Mentor newer members

### **Year 1 Target Mix** (20 members)
- 15 Tier 1 (Solidarity): 12 × $25 + 3 × $50 = $5,400/year
- 0 Tier 2 (Investment): $0 (building trust first)
- 5 Tier 3 (Stewardship): 5 × $100 = $6,000/year
- **Total**: $11,400/year revenue + $60K external funding needed

**Who are the 5 Stewardship members?**
- Invite from the 19 interviewed: Siwar (PSYAI), Louai (Courssaty), Clara (Little Stars), Iman (Hazel Farm), Hany (Takadam)
- Pitch: "You're not joining to GET support, you're joining to GIVE governance + mentorship. $100/month pays for 4 solidarity members."

---

## Final Recommendation

**Start small, but build the infrastructure RIGHT from Day 1**:

### **YEAR 1 (2025): Foundation**
- **Form**: Fiscal sponsorship (zero legal cost)
- **Launch**: Track 1 with 15 solidarity + 5 stewardship = 20 members
- **Revenue**: $11,400
- **External funding**: $65K grant (apply now)
- **Build**: Payment infrastructure ($2K) + platform ($8K) + governance frameworks

## Appendix: Next Actions

1. **Decide on funding path**: Can you raise $75K for Year 1, or start with lean $30K path?

2. **Payment infrastructure first**: Set up Stripe Atlas + Fawry + Whish Money (cost: $2K, takes 4-6 weeks)

3. **Identify Stewardship members**: Email 5 from interviewed list (Siwar, Louai, Clara, Iman, Hany) → "Would you pay $100/month to govern + mentor?"

4. **Build member platform**: Website + payment portal + governance docs (cost: $8K, takes 8 weeks)

5. **Apply for grants**: Research cooperative development grants, draft proposals (timeline: 2-3 months to approval)

Want me to draft the Stewardship member invitation email? Or model a different scenario (e.g., 50 members Year 1 instead of 20)?
