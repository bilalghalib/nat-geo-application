  "key_quotes": {
    "on_gaza_doomscrolling": "25% of my clients come because they can't work. They open their phone, see Gaza, and they can't stop scrolling. They lose the entire day. Then they feel guilty for not working, which makes them feel worse.",
    "on_niyyah_intention": "I tell them: Set your niyyah (intention) before you open your phone. Say to yourself: 'I will watch Gaza content for 10 minutes to stay informed, then I will work.' Without intention, you just drift into doomscrolling for hours.",
    "on_role_based_action": "I ask them: What is YOUR role in the Gaza situation? Are you an activist? An engineer? A psychologist? A parent? Act from your role. As a psychologist, my contribution is supporting clients with Gaza trauma. That's my role. Not watching videos all day - that's not helping anyone.",
    "on_wise_mind": "There's a DBT concept called 'wise mind' - it's the balance between emotional mind and rational mind. You can be aware of what's happening in Gaza without being consumed by it. You can hold the pain without drowning in it.",
    "on_ai_ethics": "The AI chatbot is not replacing psychologists. It's for non-specialized support - like when a friend offers you support, not therapy. For serious cases, you still need a human psychologist. AI is a supplement, not a replacement.",
    "on_jurat_amal_origin": "I started Jur'at Amal in 2019 to support cancer patients. Jur'at Amal means 'courage of hope' in Arabic. We've supported over 3,000 cancer patients since then. Now we're expanding to general mental health and adding AI, but we still serve the cancer community.",
    "on_affordable_pricing": "Our sessions are 20 JOD. Regular clinics charge 58 JOD. We're making psychology accessible, not a luxury service. Everyone deserves mental health support.",
    "on_bloom_in_person": "Online sessions are good for efficiency, but I think meeting in person during the program creates deeper connections. Maybe halfway through, bring everyone together for a day or weekend. That would make the community stronger.",
    "on_transforming_negative_impact": "We need to help people transform the negative impact of social media into productive action. Not avoidance - staying informed is important. But functional awareness, not paralysis."

    "critical_insight": "Siwar represents intersection of: (1) Ancient wisdom (niyyah/Islamic psychology), (2) Modern innovation (AI mental health chatbot), (3) Social mission (affordable access), (4) Crisis response (Gaza trauma frameworks), (5) Proven impact (5 years, 3,000+ patients). Her frameworks for Gaza doomscrolling are not just for PSYAI clients - they're regional mental health infrastructure. Cooperative fit is strong: mission-driven, values-aligned, collaborative, operational scale. Mental health sector needs careful revenue-share framing, but her equity pricing (65% cheaper than competitors) shows solidarity economy values already embedded."
