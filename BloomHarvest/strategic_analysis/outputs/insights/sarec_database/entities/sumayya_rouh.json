    "on_israeli_media_strategy": "During the Intifada, Israeli media didn't show bodies. They'd show a child's shoe with blood - and you understand there was a tragedy. They studied psychology. We need to elevate our discourse.",
    "on_gaza_personal_overwhelm": "At the start of the war, I was ready to watch news 24 hours. What do you do after that? I cried at night, sometimes didn't eat. After a while, I lost ability to watch. I felt helpless, couldn't control it. Sometimes I wouldn't open social media for 2-3 days.",
    "on_losing_humanity": "Why do we keep distorting images in strange ways for journalistic credibility and social media engagement? We forget our humanity.",
    "on_strategic_content_approach": "If I lose my audience after a month because they can't watch anymore, I've lost part of the battle. I'd rather present content with less harm to mental health AND maintain ability to bypass algorithms.",
    "on_founder_pressure": "Unfortunately, we hear everyone but no one hears us. Sometimes you must appear strong, but there are things on personal level...",
    "on_journalist_training_moment": "20 journalists came last week. I can't describe the atmosphere - they were laughing but had real desire to be heard. I felt like masks fell from their faces. For the first time I felt I really knew them.",
    "on_financial_sustainability": "The topic of funders and financial support is key for continuation. We can achieve income through productions, but sustainability became dependent on creating income sources, not just waiting for funders.",
    "on_selling_ai_tool": "I'm willing to sell the AI tool for profit, to reinvest in the humanitarian and social side. That's how Rouh can continue.",
    "on_continued_relationships": "I'm very happy you reached out, Bilal. This is first time I've experienced continued relationship after a program. Usually programs cut ties - few organizations check if initiatives continue.",

    "on_competitive_environment": "In our country, competition creates strange dynamics. Once you achieve something, people view you as threat. We need real partnerships with people whose goal isn't just financial profit.",

Her gratitude for Bilal's continued outreach ('first time experiencing this') reveals: cooperative's long-term relationship model is itself a value proposition. She explicitly seeks: (1) Sustainability beyond grants, (2) International network access, (3) Continued partnerships. Cooperative addresses all three. Her willingness to sell AI tool to fund humanitarian work = social enterprise mindset aligned with cooperative solidarity economy principles."
