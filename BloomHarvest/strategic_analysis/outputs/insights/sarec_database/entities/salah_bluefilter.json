    "on_arab_governments": "The whole world wants to help, except Arabs. Except Arabs unfortunately. Jordan and Egypt - strange policies, very strange. They put a bad mark on themselves. This is clearer than anything - this is evil, Satan walking on earth, destroying, killing, laughing in our faces. And people are still trying to find political benefit? I don't understand.",
    "on_relationships_vs_projects": "When I talk with families in Gaza, share baby photos, they share theirs - this is SO important to them, they're so happy we talk. I feel if more people had these relationships, they'd feel Gaza's cause is THEIR cause, not just abstract 'genocide bad.' It becomes personal.",
    "on_best_charity": "The Prophet ﷺ said the best charity is providing water (سقاية الماء). This is what we're working on. Alhamdulillah.",
    "on_blue_filter_materials": "We use plant seeds - olive pits, date pits, treated and mixed with eggshells. The eggshells need to be cleaned to avoid salmonella, so we sun-dry them. The mixture removes nitrites, chlorides, some pollutants. Natural materials, not chemicals - chemicals are banned from entering anyway.",
    "on_residency_programs": "The new programs I'm seeing are RESIDENCY programs. They select top 3-4 projects, give 5-year residency visa, help implement project in that country, introduce to investors. Not just $10K and goodbye. They want long-term relationship - you implement, they get equity share, investors get returns. This is the new model.",
    "on_travel_restrictions": "I lost 15 international invitations in past 2 years. I have 3 more in December - Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Italy. But I'm stuck. If I leave USA, I might not return. Even with green card - if I leave, who knows if I can come back? And I'm Palestinian, so already limited everywhere."
