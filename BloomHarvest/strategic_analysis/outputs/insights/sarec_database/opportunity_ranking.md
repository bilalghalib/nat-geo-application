| **TOTAL MEDIUM PRIORITY** | **$16-27K** | Enhances pilot experience |

### Low Priority (Nice to Have / Year 2)
| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Regional trauma-informed media network | $15-25K | Defer to Year 2 |
| Cooperative digital platform | $15-25K | Use low-tech tools Year 1 |
| Stable coin exploration | $50-100K+ | External funding required |
| Regional expansion | $50-100K+ | Year 2-3 if pilot successful |

**TOTAL YEAR 1 BUDGET (High + Medium)**: **$42-67K**

**Minimum Viable Budget (High Priority Only)**: **$26-40K**

## Success Metrics (Pilot Evaluation)

### Primary Metrics (Must Track)

**1. Member Satisfaction**
- Quarterly survey: 0-10 scale satisfaction with cooperative
- Target: Average 7+ satisfaction across pilot year
- Key question: "Would you recommend cooperative to other entrepreneurs?"

**2. Revenue-Share Compliance**
- % of members contributing 2% revenue as agreed
- Target: 80%+ compliance (acknowledging some may have zero revenue months)
- Track: Monthly revenue reporting + payments

**3. Mutual Support Engagement**
- Attendance at monthly check-ins
- Target: 70%+ attendance average across year
- Peer support instances documented (who helped whom)

**4. Financial Stability Outcomes**
- How many members accessed stability fund?
- Did fund help during revenue dips?
- Member financial sustainability improved? (self-reported)

### Secondary Metrics (Nice to Track)

**5. Collaborative Opportunities Activated**
- How many members collaborated on projects? (e.g., Siwar + Sumayya)
- Opportunities generated within network
- External opportunities accessed via Bloom recommendation

**6. Cultural/Linguistic Identity**
- Arabic usage in communications (% Arabic vs English)
- Member feedback on cultural belonging
- Islamic framework resonance (qualitative)

**7. Crisis Response**
- "Paused entrepreneurs" supported
- Gaza trauma protocols distributed (how many therapists reached?)
- Doomscrolling blog post reach + impact

### Outcome Question (Month 12)
**"After 12 months, do members want to continue? If yes, model validated. If no, what needs to change?"**

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Low Revenue-Share Compliance
**If**: Members don't pay 2% as agreed
**Mitigation**:
- Start with voluntary basis in mini-pilot (test willingness)
- Make % adjustable based on financial situation (2% when profitable, 0% during losses)
- Focus on non-financial benefits (network, support) so value doesn't depend only on $ contribution

### Risk 2: Competitive Dynamics Break Trust
**If**: Revenue transparency causes jealousy/rivalry
**Mitigation**:
- Start with high-trust subgroup (mini-pilot tests this)
- Confidential revenue sharing (only governance sees numbers, not all members)
- Percentage-based (not absolute numbers)
- Emphasize: cooperative is ALTERNATIVE to competition, not reinforcement

### Risk 3: Time Commitment Too High for Employed Entrepreneurs
**If**: Monthly check-ins feel burdensome
**Mitigation**:
- Flexible attendance (async recordings available)
- High-leverage support only (no mandatory training)
- Members set their own engagement level
- "Paused" status for overwhelmed members (no penalty)

### Risk 4: Gaza Crisis Continues, Paused Entrepreneurs Can't Rejoin
**If**: War doesn't end, Salam/Salah remain paused indefinitely
**Mitigation**:
- "Paused" status indefinite (no pressure timeline)
- Emotional support continues regardless
- Post-war rapid launch plan ready when/if war ends
- Not failure of model - solidarity during crisis IS success

### Risk 5: Pilot Fails to Validate Model
**If**: Members dissatisfied, model doesn't work, discontinue at Month 12
**Mitigation**:
- Document lessons learned rigorously
- Share findings with ecosystem (failure is data)
- Adjust and iterate (Model 2.0) OR pivot to different support model
- Mini-pilot (Louai's model) reduces risk of full failure

## Conclusion: Recommended Action Plan

### **Next 30 Days (Critical Path)**

**Week 1:**
1. Get Reem's keywords module ✓
2. Contact Sumayya for Gaza/Egypt contacts (drift tracker) ✓
3. Start Gaza doomscrolling blog draft with Siwar ✓

**Week 2:**
4. Recruit Louai + 1 volunteer for mini-pilot ✓
5. Draft mini-pilot terms (2%, 3 months) ✓

**Week 3:**
6. Introduce Dalal to Sumayya + Siwar ✓
7. Launch mini-pilot ✓

**Week 4:**
8. Start Arabic/Islamic framework document ✓
9. Design monthly "Kitchen" sessions ✓
10. Invite Salam + Salah to paused cohort ✓

### **Success Definition**

**This analysis succeeds if**:
1. Bilal can confidently move forward with pilot (knowing which opportunities to pursue)
2. Top 10 opportunities have clear implementation roadmap
3. Budget realistic and prioritized (high/medium/low)
4. Risk mitigation addresses likely obstacles
5. Success metrics enable evaluation at Month 12

**The cooperative succeeds if**:
- At Month 12, members vote to continue
- Model validated with evidence (track record for next cohort)
- Alternative to grant dependency demonstrated
- Arabic/Islamic/trauma-informed ecosystem established
- MENA entrepreneurs feel: "This is FOR us BY us"
