# Bloom Cooperative: Quick Decision Guide
**For**: Bilal - making the launch decision
**TL;DR**: You need $75-337K over 3 years depending on scale. Here's what each path looks like.

---

## The Core Numbers

**Question**: What does it cost to run a cooperative?

**Answer**:

| Members | Annual Cost | Cost/Member/Month | Self-Sustaining At |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 20 | $71K | $296/mo | NEVER (too few) |
| 50 | $100K | $167/mo | $167/mo per member |
| 100 | $130K | $108/mo | $108/mo per member |
| 200 | $185K | $77/mo | $77/mo per member |

**Implication**: At $25/month solidarity pricing, you need 80-100+ members OR external funding.

---

## Three Paths Forward

### **PATH A: Full-Scale (Recommended)**
**Goal**: Self-sustaining by Year 4 with 125 members

**Timeline**:
- Year 1: 20 members (15 solidarity @ $25 + 5 stewardship @ $100)
- Year 2: 46 members (30 solidarity + 10 stewardship + 6 investment)
- Year 3: 75 members (50 solidarity + 15 stewardship + 15 investment)
- Year 4: 125 members (80 solidarity + 20 stewardship + 25 investment) → **BREAK-EVEN**

**Funding needed**:
- Year 1: $65K (grant)
- Year 2: $142K ($100K impact investment + $42K grant)
- Year 3: $120K ($90K investment + $30K grant)
- **TOTAL**: $337K over 3 years

**You need**: Ability to raise $75K+ grants Year 1

---

### **PATH B: Lean Launch**
**Goal**: Test model cheaply, reach sustainability Year 5-6

**Timeline**:
- Year 1: 10 members (8 solidarity @ $25 + 2 stewardship @ $100)
- Year 2: 20 members (15 solidarity + 3 stewardship + 2 investment)
- Year 3: 35 members (25 solidarity + 5 stewardship + 5 investment)
- Year 4: 50 members
- Year 5: 75 members → **BREAK-EVEN**

**Funding needed**:
- Year 1: $30K (grant or personal)
- Year 2: $35K
- Year 3: $35K
- **TOTAL**: $100K over 3 years

**Tradeoffs**:
- You work part-time (defer $25K/year salary)
- Slower growth (5 years vs 4 years)
- No Track 2 capital pool (revenue-share only, no upfront capital for entrepreneurs)

**You need**: $30K grant OR personal funds

---

### **PATH C: Ultra-Lean (Fiscal Sponsorship)**
**Goal**: Test for 1 year under nonprofit sponsor, THEN decide

**Timeline**:
- Year 1: 8 members, operate as "program" under existing nonprofit
- Year 2: Evaluate → if successful, spin out and raise funding for Path A or B

**Funding needed**:
- Year 1: $25K (revenue to sponsor: 10-15% of grants)
- **TOTAL**: $25K to test

**Tradeoffs**:
- Not a true cooperative Year 1 (sponsor owns it)
- Limited governance autonomy
- Must transition eventually (spin-out costs $20-40K Year 2)

**You need**: Find fiscal sponsor willing to host (Berytech? Bloom? US nonprofit?)

**Best for**: If you want to test before committing to full launch

### **Tier 3: Stewardship** (Paying it forward)
- $100-500/month for alumni/successful entrepreneurs

## The Decision You Need to Make

### **1. Which path?**
- [ ] Path A (Full-Scale): Can you raise $75K Year 1?
- [ ] Path B (Lean): Start with $30K, defer salary, slower growth?
- [ ] Path C (Fiscal Sponsor): Test for 1 year under nonprofit?

### **2. What's your time commitment?**
- [ ] Full-time (40 hrs/week): Enables faster growth
- [ ] Part-time (20 hrs/week): Lean path only, slower timeline

### **3. What scale in Year 4?**
- [ ] 125 members (Full-Scale): Need $337K funding
- [ ] 50 members (Lean): Need $100K funding
- [ ] 20 members (Ultra-Lean): Need $60K funding

### **4. When to build payment infrastructure?**
- [ ] NOW (before launch): $2K setup, 4-6 weeks → smooth Track 1 → Track 2 transition
- [ ] Later (Year 2): Save $2K now, but harder to transition members later

**Recommendation**: Build payment infrastructure NOW even if starting lean. It's only $2K and makes everything else easier.

## Next 3 Actions (Once You Decide)

### **If Path A (Full-Scale)**:
1. **Apply for grants** (2-3 month timeline)
   - Research: Echoing Green Social Entrepreneurship, Ashoka Changemakers
   - Draft: Cooperative model proposal, 3-year budget, impact projections
2. **Set up payment infrastructure** ($2K, 4-6 weeks)
   - Stripe Atlas + Fawry + Whish Money
3. **Email Stewardship candidates** (5 from SAREC interviews)
   - Siwar, Louai, Clara, Iman, Hany
   - Pitch: $100/month to govern + mentor

### **If Path B (Lean)**:
1. **Find fiscal sponsor** (4-8 week search)
   - Contact: Berytech, Bloom Network, US nonprofits working in MENA
   - Ask: "Can we operate as program under your 501(c)(3)?"
2. **Set up payment infrastructure** ($2K)
   - Same as Path A
3. **Email 8 Track 1 candidates** (from solidarity ranking)
   - Next Generation, GebRaa, JEVAN, etc.
   - Pitch: $25/month solidarity circle, Arabic-first, 3-month pilot

### **If Path C (Ultra-Lean)**:
1. **Same as Path B** (fiscal sponsor + payment setup)
2. **Start with 5 members only** (easier to manage)
3. **Set 6-month checkpoint**: If successful → apply for grants and transition to Path A or B
