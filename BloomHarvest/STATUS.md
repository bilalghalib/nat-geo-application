# Current Status

**Where we are: November 2025**

---

## Phase: Harvest & Research

We're in a listening and learning phase. Not launching. Not fundraising. Not decided on a model yet.

**What that means practically:**
- Conducting interviews with alumni (20 completed so far)
- Analyzing the network of 1,046 teams
- Researching alternative models (cooperatives, networks)
- Documenting everything so insights don't get lost
- Testing what people need vs. what we assume they need

---

## What we've done (Oct-Nov 2025)

### Interviews (20 completed)
Talked to alumni from ACSI1-4, HerMeNow, various programs.

**Who we talked to:**
- Clara Harmouche (Little Stars) - EdTech, Lebanon
- Garene Kaloustian (Parents' Hub) - EdTech, Lebanon
- Iman Mostafa (Hazel Farm) - AgTech, Egypt
- Reem Daher (Brightful/Khutwa) - Gender justice & SRHR, Lebanon
- Hussein Husseiny (RobotX) - STEM education, Jordan
- ...and 15 others

**Files:** `/Bloom_History_And_Research/Bloom_Teams/Interview_Transcripts/`

### Data organization
- Converted 21 DOCX files → Markdown (easier to parse)
- Converted 5 XLSX files → 43 CSV files (multi-sheet spreadsheets)
- Cleaned up file structure for analysis

### Network analysis (1,046 teams)
Ran comprehensive analysis on full team database.

**Findings:**
- Total teams analyzed: 1,046
- Top 100 outreach priorities identified
- Cooperative revenue projections:
  - Conservative (10% adoption): $104,600/year
  - Moderate (30% adoption): $313,800/year
  - Optimistic (50% adoption): $523,000/year

## What we're learning

### What people valued about programs

**From Garene (Parents' Hub):**
> "I couldn't believe how supportive this space is... The time, the commitment. The opportunity to learn about these different components... For someone who needs this kind of support, it's really more human capacity building and the support network."

**From Iman (Hazel Farm):**
> "It's very nice to get inspired by examples of women who are doing amazing things... The network - that was the most important thing for me."

### What people need post-program

1. **Ongoing network access** - Don't lose the connections
2. **Peer learning** - Access to others solving similar problems
3. **Shared resources** - Collective purchasing, services
4. **Long-term mentorship** - Not just during program
5. **Community during crisis** - Mutual aid when things fall apart

### What's NOT working

- Programs end and relationships disappear
- No way to stay connected to alumni
- Everyone solving same problems independently
- Donor dependency creates fragility
- Growth metrics miss what actually matters

---

## Open questions we're exploring

1. **Structure**: Cooperative? Network? Platform? Association?
2. **Services**: What should we actually provide?
3. **Governance**: Who decides? How?
4. **Financial model**: Membership fees? Revenue share? Grants?
5. **Regional scope**: Lebanon-first? MENA-wide? Global?
6. **Crisis adaptation**: How to design for ongoing instability?

---

## What we're NOT doing (yet)

- ❌ Launching a new program
- ❌ Fundraising for operations
- ❌ Asking teams to commit to anything
- ❌ Building technology infrastructure
- ❌ Making final decisions about structure

We're in research mode. Gathering signal before committing to direction.

## Immediate next steps (Nov-Dec 2025)

### Continue interviews
- **Target:** 30 more interviews (50 total)
- **Focus:** Diverse sectors, geographies, program vintages
- **Questions:** What do you need? What would you pay for? What excites you?

### Share findings
- Circulate interview insights with alumni
- Get feedback on cooperative concept
- Test different value propositions

### Test Team Update Form
- Send to reachable alumni
- Collect: current status, needs, cooperative interest
- Goal: 100+ responses

### Research cooperatives
- Study existing models (platform co-ops, service co-ops)
- Talk to cooperative experts
- Understand legal structures in Lebanon/region

---

## Medium-term possibilities (2026)

### If research shows strong interest:

**Q1 2026: Pilot Design**
- Draft cooperative proposal with founding members
- Design pilot services (likely: community + shared resources)
- Test with 10-15 engaged teams

**Q2 2026: Pilot Launch**
- Onboard founding members
- Launch first service
- Prove value and refine

**Q3-Q4 2026: Scale Decision**
- If pilot works: expand to more teams
- If pilot doesn't work: learn and adapt
- Document everything either way

### If research shows weak interest:

**Adapt or pivot:**
- Maybe it's not a cooperative
- Maybe it's just a network
- Maybe it's sector-specific (EdTech only?)
- Maybe timing is wrong

**We'll follow what the data and conversations tell us.**

- Fill out Team Update Form (coming soon)
- Email Bilal if you want to be interviewed
- Share what you actually need

**If you're a potential partner/funder:**
- Read this doc and `VALUES.md`
- See if this aligns with your interests
- Reach out to explore collaboration

**If you're just curious:**
- Browse the interview transcripts
- Check the network analysis outputs
- Follow along as we figure this out

## Metrics (because context matters)

**Bloom history (2016-2025):**
- 1,046 teams supported
- 4 ACSI cohorts + HerMeNow + various programs
- Countries: Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, etc.
- Sectors: EdTech, FinTech, HealthTech, AgTech, Social Justice

**Current research:**
- 20 interviews completed
- 1,046 teams analyzed
- Top 100 priorities identified
- 3 revenue scenarios modeled

**What's next:**
- 30 more interviews
- Cooperative research
- Pilot design (if warranted)
- Following the signal, not the plan

---

## Context: Why now?

**External factors:**
- USAID funding ended
- Donor landscape shifting
- Lebanon in economic collapse
- War in Palestine/Lebanon
- Traditional nonprofit model struggling

**Internal factors:**
- 1,046 teams is a network waiting to be activated
- Alumni asking "what's next?"
- Frustration with donor dependency
- Want to build something sustainable

**Personal factors:**
- Bilal: Questioning accelerator model
- David: Moving to US, shifting focus
- Both: Want to consolidate rather than keep starting new programs

## How this doc will evolve

This is a living document. As we learn, this changes.

**Update frequency:** Monthly or as major developments happen

**What changes:**
- Number of interviews
- Findings and patterns
- Next steps
- Open questions

**What stays constant:**
- Commitment to listening before deciding
- Values-driven approach
- Transparency about uncertainty
