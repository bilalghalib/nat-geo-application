# What We're Learning (Nov 2025)

**Synthesized insights from 20 interviews + 1,046 team analysis**

---

## TL;DR - What the data says

**Top 5 themes** (by frequency in interviews):
1. **Sustainability** (166 mentions) - Donor dependency is THE problem
2. **Resources needed** (158 mentions) - Clear gaps in what teams have vs. need
3. **Programs valuable** (129 mentions) - People loved the programs
4. **Community support** (121 mentions) - Network is #1 value
5. **Crisis context** (114 mentions) - Operating in impossible conditions

**The signal:** People want ongoing community + shared resources, not more accelerators.

## 🎯 Core Insight: The Post-Program Gap

### What works (from programs):
- **Human capacity building** over metrics
- **Commitment & time** from experts
- **Peer connections** that last
- **Supportive environment** vs. competitive

### What breaks after programs end:
- **Network dissolves** - connections fade
- **Everyone isolated** - solving same problems alone
- **Donor chasing restarts** - back to grant treadmill
- **No sustained support** - expertise disappears

### The gap:
**6 months of deep support → lifetime of struggling alone**

This is the problem to solve.

## 💡 Key Learnings by Theme

### 1. Sustainability (166 mentions)

**What people said:**
- "Lebanon is so dependent on aid and we need a lot more opportunity to be more self-sustainable"
- Tired of donor dependency
- Want predictable income
- Need financial models that aren't grant-based

**What this means:**
- Any new model MUST address sustainability
- Cooperative/revenue-sharing models resonate
- People will pay for value (but need to see ROI)
- Membership fees > grants (for long-term health)

**Actionable:**
- Test willingness to pay ($50-200/month)
- Pilot shared services that save money
- Prove ROI quickly (first 90 days)

---

### 2. Resources Needed (158 mentions)

**What people said:**
- "What I'm looking for is to be on high-level discussions with decision makers"
- Need access to expertise (not just one-time workshops)
- Missing: network, mentorship, shared services
- Want: connections, resources, ongoing support

**What this means:**
People need ACCESS more than TRAINING:
- Access to expert network
- Access to peer community
- Access to shared resources (legal, accounting, etc.)
- Access to decision-makers/funders

**Actionable:**
- Build expert network (consultants who give time)
- Create resource library (templates, contacts)
- Facilitate intros (teams ↔ funders/partners)

---

### 3. Programs Valuable (129 mentions)

**What worked:**
- "I couldn't believe how supportive this space is"
- "The network - that was the most important thing"
- "The commitment, the time from experts"
- Long-term engagement (weeks/months, not days)

**What didn't:**
- Programs end abruptly
- Not enough depth in some areas
- Can't customize pace/focus per team

**What this means:**
Don't throw away what works. Build on it:
- Keep: Cohort model, expert access, peer learning
- Change: Make it ongoing, not time-bound
- Add: Alumni can mentor new cohorts

**Actionable:**
- Alumni-led workshops (reduce costs, build community)
- Rotating expertise (15 experts × 1 hour/month = sustainable)
- Asynchronous resources + synchronous connection

---

### 4. Community Support (121 mentions)

**What people said:**
- "We go further when we go together"
- Valued peer connections most
- Want ongoing network access
- Need community during crisis

**What this means:**
The NETWORK is the product, not the program:
- 1,046 teams is the asset
- Connections > curriculum
- Peer support > expert advice (sometimes)
- Community = resilience during crisis

**Actionable:**
- Facilitate peer matching (sector, stage, geography)
- Create working groups (15 people tackling same problem)
- Host regular meetups (virtual + in-person when safe)

---

### 5. Crisis Context (114 mentions)

**The reality:**
- War in Lebanon/Palestine
- Economic collapse
- Power cuts daily
- Infrastructure failing
- Can't plan beyond next week

**What this means:**
Design for crisis, not stability:
- Asynchronous > synchronous (power cuts!)
- Mutual aid built-in (when one suffers, others help)
- Flexible models (can't predict next month)
- Resilience = core feature

**Actionable:**
- WhatsApp/Signal over email (works with bad internet)
- Record everything (people miss live sessions)
- Emergency fund in cooperative (mutual aid)

---

## 🔍 Patterns Across Interviews

### Pattern 1: "Network was the most valuable part"

Almost everyone mentioned:
- Connections with peers > content
- Stayed in touch after programs
- Collaborated with cohort members
- Want more of this

**Implication:**
The accelerator taught skills, but the network gave resilience.
Focus on network activation, not program delivery.

---

### Pattern 2: "I'd pay for sustained support"

Multiple people said variations of:
- "I would love to be part of this"
- "I'm very interested in this experiment"
- "What's the baseline/criteria to join?"

**Implication:**
There IS appetite for paid membership if value is clear.
People will invest in community + resources.

---

### Pattern 3: "Different sectors, same struggles"

Whether EdTech, AgTech, FinTech, Health:
- Same donor fatigue
- Same resource gaps
- Same need for peer support
- Same interest in cooperation

**Implication:**
Don't silo by sector initially.
Cross-sector learning is valuable.
Maybe specialize later (EdTech co-op, etc.)

---

### Pattern 4: "Programs end, relationships disappear"

Direct quotes:
- "How do we stay supportive after programs end?"
- "It's always like 'oh my God, now it's all over'"
- "We don't have resources to stay connected"

**Implication:**
This is the #1 pain point.
Solving this = solving the core problem.

## 💰 Revenue Model Insights

From conversations about cooperative model:

**Reactions:**
- "That's a very refreshing approach"
- "I'm very interested and curious"
- "What's the criteria to be part of this?"
- Some confusion, but mostly excitement

**Concerns:**
- "How do I know it's sustainable?"
- "What's in it for me vs. giving?"
- "Will this actually work?"

**What works:**
- Ubuntu framing ("we go further together")
- Shared risk/shared reward
- Stabilization pool concept
- Not extractive investment

**What to clarify:**
- Specific services delivered
- Clear ROI (save $X/month on Y)
- Governance (who decides what)
- Exit strategy (what if it doesn't work)

## 🚀 What People Would Actually Use

Based on what they said they need:

### Tier 1: Community (everyone wants)
- Monthly peer meetups
- WhatsApp/Signal groups by sector
- Alumni directory (searchable)
- Intro facilitation

### Tier 2: Resources (high value)
- Shared legal/accounting services
- Templates & playbooks
- Expert office hours (rotating)
- Crisis preparedness resources

### Tier 3: Advanced (some want)
- Revenue pooling / stabilization
- Joint fundraising
- Collective purchasing
- Platform plays (EdTech consortium, etc.)

**Start with Tier 1+2. Test Tier 3 with pilot.**

---

## ⚠️ Warning Signals

### What could go wrong:

1. **"Too business-focused people won't join"**
   - Need values-aligned founders
   - Screen for Ubuntu mindset
   - Not everyone is a fit

2. **"Money ruins relationships"**
   - Acknowledged in interviews
   - Need clear agreements
   - Maybe start with community, add $ later

3. **"What about early-stage teams with no revenue?"**
   - Different model needed
   - Maybe mentor-only membership?
   - Or invest in them (not extract)

4. **"This requires trust, and we just met"**
   - Can't force it
   - Start small (10-15 founding members)
   - Grow organically

2. **Host exploratory call** - "Would you actually join?"
3. **Co-design pilot** with founding members
4. **Test willingness to pay** - survey on pricing

### Short-term (Q1 2026):
5. **Launch Tier 1** - Community only (WhatsApp, monthly calls, directory)
6. **Pilot Tier 2** - Shared services with 10 teams
7. **Measure impact** - Time saved, money saved, connections made
8. **Document learnings** - What works, what doesn't

### Medium-term (Q2-Q3 2026):
9. **Expand if successful** - Invite next cohort (20-30 teams)
10. **Add Tier 3** - Revenue pooling with interested subset
11. **Refine model** - Based on 6 months of data
12. **Scale decision** - Go big or stay boutique?

---

## 🌱 What Success Looks Like

**Not:**
- X teams onboarded
- $Y revenue generated
- Z programs delivered

**But:**
- Teams staying in business (survival rate)
- Meaningful collaborations formed (#)
- Cost savings demonstrated ($)
- Community engagement (attendance, participation)
- Wellbeing & resilience (qualitative)

**The ultimate metric:**
**Are teams stronger together than they were alone?**

If yes → we're onto something.
If no → learn and adapt.

## 💭 Meta-Learning: How We Learn

This document itself is an experiment:
- **Quantitative** (166 mentions of X) + **Qualitative** (actual quotes)
- **Themes** (what's repeated) + **Outliers** (unique insights)
- **Data** (numbers) + **Stories** (human experience)

**We need all three lenses:**
1. **What people say** (interviews)
2. **What the data shows** (patterns)
3. **What we observe** (behavior vs. stated preference)

Keep triangulating.
