# Bloom Harvest

**A research and reflection project exploring what comes after 1,046 teams.**

---

## What is this?

Since 2016, Bloom has supported 1,046 social entrepreneurs across the MENA region through accelerator programs. We've run ACSI (1-4), HerMeNow, and various other programs with amazing founders building everything from EdTech to AgTech to social impact ventures.

**Now we're in a harvest phase.** The world has changed. USAID funding ended. The nonprofit industrial complex is shifting. Lebanon is in crisis. Palestine is under siege. The old models aren't working.

This repository is where we're:
- **Listening** to what alumni need and want
- **Analyzing** the network of 1,046 teams to find patterns
- **Researching** alternative models (cooperatives, networks, mutual aid)
- **Documenting** insights so nothing gets lost in chat history
- **Exploring** what post-accelerator support could look like

**This is not a finished product**. It's working notes, transcripts, data, and tools for sense-making.

## What's in here?

### `/Bloom_History_And_Research/`
All the history - interview transcripts (now in markdown!), team data, program documents, research papers.

**Key sections:**
- `Bloom_Teams/Interview_Transcripts/` - 20 interviews converted to markdown
- `Bloom_Teams/All_Teams_Airtable_Export...csv` - Full export of 1,046 teams
- `Program/` - Program designs, frameworks, assessments
- `Bloom_Website/` - Public content and reports

### `/strategic_analysis/`
Analysis tools and outputs exploring the transition from accelerator to cooperative model.

**What's been analyzed:**
- 1,046 teams clustered and prioritized
- Cooperative revenue projections (conservative: $104K/year → optimistic: $523K/year)
- Top 100 outreach priorities
- Partnership opportunities

See `/strategic_analysis/README.md` for full details.

### `/convert_files.py`
Utility script that converted all DOCX → Markdown and XLSX → CSV to make everything easier to parse and analyze.

## Where are we now?

**Status: Research & Harvest Phase** (Nov 2025)

We're conducting interviews with alumni to understand:
- What was valuable about the programs?
- What do people need now that programs have ended?
- Is there appetite for ongoing community/support?
- What would a cooperative or alumni network look like?

**Not** launching anything yet. **Not** fundraising yet. Just listening, learning, and building understanding.

See `STATUS.md` for current progress.

## Core questions we're exploring

1. **Alumni engagement**: How do we stay connected to 1,046 teams after programs end?
2. **Sustainability**: How do we move beyond donor dependency?
3. **Collective power**: What happens if these teams support each other?
4. **Context-appropriate**: What works in MENA region with crisis, infrastructure challenges, etc.?
5. **Values alignment**: Can we build something that rejects extractive growth models?

## Values

The work is guided by principles we've learned over 9 years:

- **Ubuntu**: We go far when we go together
- **Long-term relationships** over short-term transactions
- **Human capacity** over metrics and scale
- **Context-aware**: MENA ≠ Silicon Valley
- **Resilience in crisis**: Operating in Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan despite challenges
- **Anti-extractive**: Rejecting neoliberal competition for regenerative cooperation

See `VALUES.md` for full articulation.

## Who this is for

**Primary audience**: Potential partners and funders who want to understand what we're researching and why it matters.

**Also useful for**:
- Alumni teams wondering what's next
- Collaborators (David, etc.) staying aligned
- Future us (6 months from now) remembering what we learned

## How to engage

**If you're an alum**i: Check `/strategic_analysis/TEAM_UPDATE_FORM.md` - we'd love your input on what's next.

**If you're a funder/partner**: Read this README, then see `STATUS.md` for where we are and what we're learning.

**If you're curious**: Browse `/Bloom_History_And_Research/Bloom_Teams/Interview_Transcripts/` to hear directly from founders.

## Technical notes

- **All files converted to text formats** (MD, CSV, JSON) for easy parsing
- **Git repo** for version control and collaboration
- **Analysis scripts** in Python for processing team data
- **Claude Code integration** - see `CLAUDE.md` for working with AI assistant

## Questions?

This is exploratory work. We don't have all the answers. That's the point.
