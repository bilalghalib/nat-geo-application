# Bloom Values

**Principles that guide our work, extracted from 9 years of practice**

---

## Ubuntu: We go further together

"We don't have perfect electricity and a bunch of Ivy League college grads desperate for startup jobs. We're not in Silicon Valley. This is not the ecosystem we're working with... We need to think not like 'me against all' but 'all for all' - building a real living ecology of different organizations supporting each other."

— Bilal, from interview with Garene (Parents' Hub)

**What this means:**
- Reject Silicon Valley's competitive extraction model
- Build mutual support networks, not hero entrepreneurs
- Value cooperation over competition
- Recognize we're stronger collectively than individually

---

## Long-term relationships over programs

"I've been frustrated for a while that we are with you guys on your journey for almost six months...and then we don't have the resources and ability to stay supportive."

— Bilal, from multiple interviews

**What this means:**
- Don't just run programs and disappear
- Build lasting relationships with alumni
- Stay connected beyond the accelerator cycle
- Alumni engagement is not an afterthought—it's core

---

## Context-aware: MENA ≠ Silicon Valley

Operating in Lebanon during crisis. Palestine under occupation. Power cuts. Infrastructure challenges. War. Economic collapse.

**What this means:**
- Design for the actual context, not idealized conditions
- Crisis preparedness and mutual aid are built-in
- Don't import Western models without adaptation
- Resilience is a feature, not a bug

---

## Human capacity over growth metrics

"For me, the biggest thing in terms of follow-up is the availability of the experts...the commitment, the support network. It's really more human capacity building."

— Garene (Parents' Hub)

**What this means:**
- Prioritize learning and relationship-building
- Not everything needs to scale
- Quality of support > quantity of participants
- Measure impact in capability, not just numbers

---

## Anti-extractive / Regenerative

"I think a lot of this neoliberal economic strategy of 'as much as possible without damaging the system irreparably' is part of the problem."

— Bilal

**What this means:**
- Reject extractive growth-at-all-costs models
- Don't chase "1000x returns" for investors
- Build regenerative, sustainable systems
- Question whose metrics we're optimizing for

---

## Sustainability over donor dependency

"Lebanon is so dependent on aid and we need a lot more opportunity to be more self-sustainable."

— Garene

**What this means:**
- Move away from endless grant chasing
- Build revenue models that aren't donor-dependent
- Create self-sustaining community structures
- Cooperatives, not just nonprofits

---

## Feminist & Inclusive

Supporting programs like HerMeNow. Platforming founders working on SRHR, gender justice, women's empowerment.

**What this means:**
- Center marginalized voices
- Support women entrepreneurs intentionally
- Address systemic barriers, not just individual capacity
- Intersectional approach to impact

---

## Network effects & collective power

"You've trained 1,011 teams. That's not just a portfolio - it's a network effect waiting to be unlocked... 1,011 teams collectively = unstoppable force."

— From strategic analysis

**What this means:**
- See the forest, not just the trees
- Find synergies across the network
- Unlock value through connection
- The whole is greater than the parts

---

## Permaculture / Systems thinking

Bilal does foraging, studies permaculture, thinks in ecological systems.

**What this means:**
- Design for emergence, not control
- Work with natural patterns and rhythms
- Build resilient, adaptive systems
- Everything is connected

---

## Transparent about uncertainty

This document itself is a work-in-progress. We're in a harvest phase, listening and learning.

**What this means:**
- Don't pretend to have all the answers
- Be honest about what we don't know
- Invite input and collaboration
- Working notes > polished marketing

---

## How these show up in practice

**In programs:**
- Weekly commitment over months, not one-off workshops
- Bringing experts who give time generously
- Building peer relationships between cohort members
- Focus on support, not just pitch training

**In crisis:**
- Continuing programs despite war, power cuts, economic collapse
- Mutual aid and resource-sharing
- Checking on teams' wellbeing, not just metrics

**In transition:**
- Taking time to listen before deciding next model
- Interviewing alumni to understand needs
- Researching cooperatives, not assuming accelerator 2.0
- Documenting everything so insights persist

---

## These values are not static

They've evolved through practice. They'll keep evolving.

What matters is we stay grounded in:
- **Ubuntu** (together)
- **Context** (where we are)
- **Relationships** (who we're with)
- **Regeneration** (how we build)
