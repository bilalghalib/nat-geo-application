* National Geographic Explorers must apply for Level II funding  
* Specific funding amounts not specified in the document

### **Level I:**

 LI grants are designed for individuals who may be earlier in their career, those looking to establish themselves better in their field, or those who want to grow their network and enhance their impact by joining a global community of National Geographic Explorers. 

LI grants are open to those who are not currently a National Geographic Explorer. Individuals in our network who are not yet Explorers, including team members on previous grants, Young Explorers awarded in 2019 or later, or recipients of discretionary funding opportunities such as the COVID-19 Emergency Fund for Journalists and the COVID-19 Remote Learning Emergency Fund, and grant recipients from the China Air & Water Fund may apply for a Level I opportunity.


**Q: What are the eligibility criteria for LI?**

* Applicant must have relevant education expertise (either formal or informal)  
* Project must align to the Education primary focus  
* Project must align to one of National Geographic’s Focus Areas (Land, Ocean, Human Histories & Cultures, Space, or Planetary Health)  
* Candidate must not be a current National Geographic staff member  
* Candidate must be over the age of 18  
* Project budget may not exceed $20,000  
* Project must be completed within 1 years of receipt of funding  
* Application materials must be complete enough to be able to assess candidate’s skills and experience, as well as the project idea

### **Level II:**

LII grants are designed for individuals who are more established in their field, have previously received a grant from the National Geographic Society, or are seeking a higher level of funding. You are not required to have previously received a grant from the National Geographic Society to apply for this opportunity.

Projects at this level should push the boundaries of the applicant’s field or discipline and be designed to achieve significant and tangible impacts. LII grants are open to those who are already National Geographic Explorers, as well as those who are not Explorers. 

**Q: What are the eligibility criteria for LII?**

* Applicant must have relevant education expertise (either formal or informal)

* Project must align to one of National Geographic’s focus Areas (Land, Ocean, Human Histories & Cultures, Space, or Planetary Health)  
* Candidate must not be a current National Geographic staff member  
* Candidate must be over the age of 18  
* Project budget is on average $50,000-$65,000 USD and may not exceed $100,000 USD  
* Project must be completed within 2 years of receipt of funding  
* Application materials must be complete enough to be able to assess candidate’s skills and experience, as well as the project idea

## **PROJECTS THAT WILL NOT BE FUNDED**

### **Lack of Educational Framework**

* Projects without clearly identified group of learners, learning activities, and learning outcomes  
* Awareness-raising activities only (conference presentations, social media campaigns)  
* Resource creation without educational component (books, podcasts without learner engagement)  
* Conservation or storytelling projects (documentaries) lacking description of learner knowledge/skills development  
* *Note: Projects combining education WITH conservation, science, research, or storytelling ARE welcome*

### **Skills Without Planetary Connection**

* Projects where learners develop skills without clear connection to planetary/environmental action  
* Educational experiences focused solely on curriculum/lesson plan development and testing  
* Skills training that doesn't lead to actions benefiting the planet and its people

### **Tool-Focused Rather Than Impact-Focused**

* Projects prioritizing the technology/tool over educational solutions for planetary action  
* Teaching technology use as the end goal rather than means to environmental stewardship  
* Example: Teaching AI for geospatial modeling where the goal is technical proficiency, not planetary protection

### **Risks**

Explain the main risks or challenges that you might encounter while completing your project, and how you plan to address them.

NGS recognizes that no project is completely risk-free or without challenges, and that projects can be impacted by factors outside of your control. Please provide a realistic assessment of the main risks or challenges (such as social, political, physical, technical, logistical, financial, safety, etc.) you may encounter while completing your project, and what back-up plans you have in place to overcome them.

### **Sustained Impact (If Applicable)**

If applicable, how will your project be sustained once your NGS grant ends?

Not all NGS grant-funded projects are intended to continue past their proposed end date. However, many Explorers continue their activities, scale up their work, or continue to achieve results well beyond their NGS funding period. If this question applies to your project, how will you ensure that your project continues to thrive after the NGS grant period ends? What relationships, funding, leadership and management systems, etc. will you put in place to make sure your impacts don’t fade once your NGS grant ends?
