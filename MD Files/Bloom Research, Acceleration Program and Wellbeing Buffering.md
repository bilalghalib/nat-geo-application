## Research Proposal  
### Character Strengths and Fostering Post-Traumatic Growth

---

## 1. End of Program Addendum

2020 brought significant challenges to Social Entrepreneurship in Lebanon due to the global pandemic, economic collapse, political instability, shortages of essentials, unemployment, and the August 2020 Beirut explosion.

Bloom uses the **Values in Action (VIA) Character Strengths** assessment for program monitoring and support. VIA helps identify strengths that support social entrepreneurial aims.

### Key Insights
- Wellbeing and life satisfaction correlate with **self-efficacy and productivity**.  
- Teams that feel resourced perform better despite chaos.  
- Bloom conducted qualitative and quantitative research comparing the 6‑month ACSI Accelerator vs. the 2‑week Sprint program.  
- The focus: **How do Bloom programs affect participants’ character strengths and support Post‑Traumatic Growth (PTG)?**

## 2. Post‑Traumatic Stress vs. Post‑Traumatic Growth

### After traumatic events, research identifies three common outcomes:
1. Some develop **PTSD**  
2. Most return to baseline  
3. A minority experience **Post‑Traumatic Growth (PTG)**

### PTG includes:
- New strengths  
- New possibilities  
- Spiritual development  
- Closer relationships  
- Greater appreciation of life  

Entrepreneurship programs rarely integrate trauma‑informed approaches. In an era of disruption, understanding how to support PTG is essential.

## 3. Evidence from the ACSI Program

Bloom analyzed Character Strengths among:
- **Accelerator participants (13 people)**  
- **Sprint‑only participants (17 people)**  

Assessments were conducted:
- At program start (April 2020)  
- At program end (Dec 2020 – Jan 2021)

### Key Finding
- Accelerator participants: **+0.2 increase** in aggregated Character Strengths  
- Sprint‑only participants: **–0.6 decrease**

The program appears to **buffer participants** from the negative psychological effects of the year’s crises.

## 4. Buffering Effects on Wellbeing & Life Satisfaction

Bloom identified traits with the strongest buffering effect.

### Highest Buffering Effects (Accelerator vs Non‑Accelerator)

| Trait | WB Corr | LS Corr | Accel Change | Non‑Accel Change | Buffer Effect |
|-------|---------|----------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Hope | .30 | .53 | -0.04 | -1.43 | 1.39 |
| Love | .18 | .35 | -0.27 | -1.84 | 1.57 |
| Humor | .25 | .26 | 1.12 | -0.55 | 1.67 |
| Curiosity | .25 | .39 | 0.96 | -0.52 | 1.48 |
| Zest | .34 | .52 | 0.35 | -0.77 | 1.11 |
| Gratitude | .21 | .43 | -0.15 | -0.73 | 0.58 |

**Average buffering effect:** 1.25

Humor shows the highest effect — consistent with research linking humor to adaptive coping.

## 5. Strengths Supporting Entrepreneurial Success

Research suggests certain traits correlate with entrepreneurial success:

| Character Strength | Accelerator Change | Non‑Accel Change | Buffer Effect |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Authenticity | -0.65 | -1.82 | 1.17 |
| Leadership | 0.00 | -1.75 | 1.75 |
| Zest | 0.35 | -0.77 | 1.11 |
| Gratitude | -0.15 | -0.73 | 0.58 |
| Fairness | 0.73 | -1.32 | 2.05 |

Average buffering effect: **1.33**

---

## 6. Combined Effects: Entrepreneurial + PTG Potential

Traits showing potential for greater integration:

| Trait | Buffer Effect | Total Impact |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Persistence | 3.19 | 1.292 |
| Hope | 1.39 | 0.852 |
| Zest | 1.12 | 0.801 |
| Leadership | 1.75 | 0.522 |

These traits meaningfully support both **entrepreneurial performance** and **wellbeing**.

---

## 7. Practical Program Applications

Bloom aims to integrate Character Strengths and universal skills into entrepreneurial support programs. Why?

- Program impact grows when both **enterprise skills** and **personal development** are strengthened.  
- This is especially important in vulnerable and marginalized communities.  

Focusing on key strengths such as **Hope, Persistence, Zest, Leadership, Gratitude** may enhance both wellbeing and venture success.

---

## 8. Further Exploration

Two factors strongly correlated with PTG:
1. **Social Support**  
2. **Deliberate Rumination** — intentional meaning‑making (“What am I learning?”) vs intrusive rumination (“Why me?”)

Creating trusted group settings enhances positive reflection and PTG.

Over **60% of people worldwide** experience trauma during their life.

---

## 9. Transformational Potential

Traumatic events can catalyze transformation.

Bloom believes entrepreneurship programs can support this by:
- Creating new possibilities  
- Providing positive social support  
- Facilitating collective positive rumination  
- Highlighting & growing key Character Strengths  

These create conditions where personal trauma can become **societal transformation**.
