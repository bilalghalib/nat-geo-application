## Request for Proposals  
**The Future of Learning, The Future of our Planet**  
**Submission Deadline:** November 19, 2025 at 11:59 PM EDT

Our world is facing big, complex, and rapidly changing environmental and societal challenges. Regardless of what the future may hold, learners will need support to develop capacities to learn about, care for, and take action to protect our world.

### Key Questions
- How do you imagine the future for our planet and its people?  
- What skills, attitudes, and knowledge do people need to design a future that leads to healthier outcomes for people and nature?  
- What learning solutions develop these capacities?  
- How might we shift minds and behaviors to create positive impacts for biodiversity and human communities?

Building the future we want requires designing for that future today. Insights from many disciplines can inform effective teaching and learning approaches to these complex, changing, interconnected challenges.

We must develop and scale models of effective learning — not just in formal education, but also informal spaces, community learning, career-connected environments, and across ages from young children to adults.

## Our Approach to Education

National Geographic places education at the intersection of exploration and learning. Education has been a pillar of the mission since the organization’s founding.

### What We Believe
- **Science** provides facts, solutions, and data.  
- **Storytelling** builds emotional connection.  
- **Education** equips people to act.

### Our Definitions
- **Education:** Processes and methods through which learners of any age acquire attitudes, skills, and knowledge.  
- **Educator:** Any learning professional or community member who enables learning and conditions for change.  
- **Learners:** People of any age; lifelong learning matters.  
- **Where learning happens:** Anywhere—schools, community spaces, informal environments.

### Through our grants program, we fund education projects that:
- Advance knowledge on how to spark curiosity and inspire learners to care for and protect the world  
- Pilot new learning solutions or scale proven ones  
- Enable learners to acquire new knowledge, skills, behaviors, attitudes  
- Use interdisciplinary approaches

## What We Aim to Fund
Projects or research that **enact the future today**, cultivating knowledge, attitudes, and skills that enable action benefiting the planet and its people.

### Eligible Proposal Types
- **Project:** Pilot a new learning solution or scale a proven one to new geographies or populations  
- **Research:** Measure effectiveness of educational innovations that help learners design a future benefiting people and nature
