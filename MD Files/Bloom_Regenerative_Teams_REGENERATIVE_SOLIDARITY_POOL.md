# 2. Why Solidarity Finance Enables Regenerative Work

## 🌍 The Problem  
Traditional impact finance often **does not align** with regenerative ecological work.

| Regenerative Work Requires | Investors Usually Expect |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Multi‑year soil restoration | Quarterly growth |
| Low-margin community services | High returns / exponential scale |
| Place‑based stewardship | Rapid scalability |
| Crisis‑context operations | “Stable” markets |

## 💬 Insights from 22 Co‑Design Calls
Key patterns:
- Teams work **second jobs** → burnout, turnover  
- Ecological projects **paused** due to financial instability  
- Revenue cycles are **seasonal**, mismatched with investor expectations  

Direct quotes:
- “Economy too constrained to register.” — *Salaam, Palestine*  
- “Work is life‑saving but financially blocked.” — *Salah, Palestine*  
- “Farming is long-term work, not quick revenue.” — *Iman, Egypt*
